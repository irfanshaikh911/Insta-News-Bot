"Oh hey, Pauline is Donkey Kong’s co-op partner in Bananza","Nintendo confirms young Pauline will not only appear in Donkey Kong Bananza for Switch 2, but she's playable in 2-player co-op using mouse controls.","{'thumbnail': 'https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNU1iWFpCWlVaelMxOHpXa3hpVFJERkF4aWxCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df-rw', 'thumbnailProxied': 'https://img.devisty.store/newsimage/CC8iI0NnNU1iWFpCWlVaelMxOHpXa3hpVFJERkF4aWxCU2dLTWdB'}",True,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/607651/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline-coop-2-player-nintendo-direct,Polygon,"Nintendo confirms kid Pauline will make Bananza a third-person shouter by  Michael McWhertor We already suspected that New Donk City mayor Pauline might make an appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch 2, but Nintendo just confirmed in a new Nintendo Direct the one-time-damsel-in-distress will not only show up in the game, she’ll be Donkey Kong’s co-op partner in their new adventure. Pauline will also appear as Odd Rock, a small purple gemlike gremlin cursed by enemy apes VoidCo. But she’ll also be present in human form, albeit much younger looking than we’ve seen her before. As previously theorized, the younger Pauline in Donkey Kong Bananza would logically place DK’s new adventure in the past — seemingly before the original 1982 Donkey Kong. Timeline questions aside, Pauline will serve as Donkey Kong’s charge and sidekick. Using the power of song, Pauline will be able to help DK (and players) spot hidden treasure using a sonar-like shout. She’ll also be able to use her voice in combat; Donkey Kong Bananza will feature a two-player co-op option, letting one player control Pauline’s voice using Switch 2’s mouse controls. Pauline can shout words like “YEAH!,” “WOW!,” and “BAM!,” words that become physical projectiles that will damage enemies and objects in the environment. That makes Donkey Kong Bananza a… third-person shouter. It seems that kid Pauline will bring plenty of musical flair to Donkey Kong Bananza. Nintendo’s new Direct presentation Anyway, while Nintendo’s got some explaining to do about Pauline and Donkey Kong’s history after confirming that kid Pauline will be present and playable in Bananza, there’s a lot to look forward to, gameplay-wise, in the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive. Donkey Kong Bananza will be released on Switch 2 on July 17.

For the past few years, Google has been leveraging Samsung to build custom Tensor chipsets for its Pixel devices. It’s been a fairly rocky road, but despite improvements in recent years, Google has been moving towards a fully custom design produced by TSMC. That effort will make its debut later this year in the Pixel 10 series, as Tensor G5 will be the first Google chip made by TSMC, the same foundry that produces chips for Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple. The change apparently came as a “shock” to Samsung, or so claims a report from The Bell (via @Jukanlosreve). Samsung is apparently in the midst of an internal inspection to analyze “the case” of Google switching from Samsung’s foundry to TSMC. Referred to as “the Google incident,” the analysis is apparently serving as a bit of a wake-up call for Samsung’s foundry efforts. An industry insider said that “losing Google is a case that shows the complex problems of Samsung Foundry at once” and that “there are many discussions and concerns going on internally as well.”  The report brings out that “Google’s desired performance and functions were diversifying,” with Samsung’s “lack of semiconductor design assets” playing a role in Google’s decision to move to TSMC. Samsung’s ongoing issues with yield with a 3nm process has also been a growing problem. And Google isn’t alone in moving beyond Samsung. A report from late May further showed that Samsung is struggling to find customers for its chips in general due to TSMC’s much higher yield. Where Samsung’s yield is apparently around 50% for its 3nm process, TSMC is said to be at 90%. While Google won’t be using Samsung for its Tensor chipset, the Pixel 10 is still expected to use a Samsung modem, per recent leaks.

 Midjourney, one of the most popular AI image generation startups, announced on Wednesday the launch of its much-anticipated AI video generation model, V1. V1 is an image-to-video model, in which users can upload an image — or take an image generated by one of Midjourney’s other models — and V1 will produce a set of four five-second videos based on it. Much like Midjourney’s image models, V1 is only available through Discord, and it’s only available on the web at launch. Introducing our V1 Video Model. It's fun, easy, and beautiful. Available at 10$/month, it's the first video model for *everyone* and it's available now. pic.twitter.com/iBm0KAN8uy The launch of V1 puts Midjourney in competition with AI video generation models from other companies, such as OpenAI’s Sora, Runway’s Gen 4, Adobe’s Firefly, and Google’s Veo 3. While many companies are focused on developing controllable AI video models for use in commercial settings, Midjourney has always stood out for its distinctive AI image models that cater to creative types.  The company says it has larger goals for its AI video models than generating B-roll for Hollywood films or commercials for the ad industry. In a blog post, Midjourney CEO David Holz says its AI video model is the company’s next step toward its ultimate destination, creating AI models “capable of real-time open-world simulations.” After AI video models, Midjourney says it plans to develop AI models for producing 3D renderings, as well as real-time AI models. The launch of Midjourney’s V1 model comes just a week after the startup was sued by two of Hollywood’s most notorious film studios: Disney and Universal. The suit alleges that images created by Midjourney’s AI image models depict the studio’s copyrighted characters, like Homer Simpson and Darth Vader. Hollywood studios have struggled to confront the rising popularity of AI image and video-generating models, such as the ones Midjourney develops. There’s a growing fear that these AI tools could replace or devalue the work of creatives in their respective fields, and several media companies have alleged that these products are trained on their copyrighted works. While Midjourney has tried to pitch itself as different from other AI image and video startups — more focused on creativity than immediate commercial applications — the startup cannot escape these accusations. To start, Midjourney says it will charge 8x more for a video generation than a typical image generation, meaning subscribers will run out of their monthly allotted generations significantly faster when creating videos than images. At launch, the cheapest way to try out V1 is by subscribing to Midjourney’s $10-per-month Basic plan. Subscribers to Midjourney’s $60-a-month Pro plan and $120-a-month Mega plan will have unlimited video generations in the company’s slower, “Relax” mode. Over the next month, Midjourney says it will reassess its pricing for video models. midjourney introduces video generation and it’s surpassing all my expectations. pic.twitter.com/lWqakbSTVV V1 comes with a few custom settings that allow users to control the video model’s outputs. Users can select an automatic animation setting to make an image move randomly, or they can select a manual setting that allows users to describe, in text, a specific animation they want to add to their video. Users can also toggle the amount of camera and subject movement by selecting “low motion” or “high motion” in settings. While the videos generated with V1 are only five seconds long, users can choose to extend them by four seconds up to four times, meaning that V1 videos could get as long as 21 seconds. Much like Midjourney’s AI image models, early demos of V1’s videos look somewhat otherworldly, rather than hyperrealistic. The initial response to V1 has been positive, though it’s still unclear how well it matches up against other leading AI video models, which have been on the market for months or even years. Topics

Google’s new AI video generation model will come to Shorts later this summer. YouTube is bringing its Veo 3 AI video generation model, which my colleague Allison Johnson recently called “a slop monger’s dream,” to YouTube Shorts later this summer, according to a Cannes Lions keynote from YouTube CEO Neal Mohan. Shorts creators can already take advantage of the previous-generation Veo 2 model to generate backgrounds with Dream Screen as well as standalone clips. Mohan didn’t specify exactly what Veo 3 will enable in Shorts, but he did mention Veo 3’s improved video quality and that it can incorporate audio, so presumably those upgrades will be coming to Shorts. It’s also unclear if Shorts creators will have to pay to use Veo 3. Right now, generating Veo 3 videos requires a paid subscription to Google’s AI Pro or AI Ultra plans. Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.  Mohan also announced that Shorts are now averaging more than 200 billion views per day.

Last year, for example, Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi, marketing chief Greg Joswiak, and top AI researcher John Giannandrea joined Gruber on stage at the California Theatre in San Jose to discuss Apple Intelligence and more. Apple's response to Gruber's interview request (basically)That decade-long tradition abruptly came to an end last month, when Apple declined Gruber's invitation to speak for this year's special episode. A few months prior to that, Gruber published a blog post that was heavily critical of Apple. In that piece, the well-known Apple pundit said that the company ""pitched a story that wasn't true"" at WWDC 2024, when it previewed a more personalized Siri that was not close to being ready and is now delayed. He said that the situation damaged Apple's credibility, and he expressed concern that it could be a sign of bigger problems inside the company. Unsurprisingly, Apple did not like the commentary. In the latest episode of the Channels podcast, Gruber told Business Insider's Peter Kafka that Apple was ""not happy"" about the blog post and felt it was unfair. However, Gruber said Apple's absence was actually a net positive for him. ""I'm not trying to lack humility here — but I feel them deciding not to do my show this year is a total win for me and was a huge loss for them,"" he said. Why does he believe that? ""I think it asserts my independence,"" he argued. ""And I think more than making me look good, I think it makes them look bad."" For his WWDC 2025 episode, Gruber ended up interviewing The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern and The Verge's Nilay Patel.  Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

However, as it goes with most new DDV additions, unlocking him isn’t easy. Peter Pan is part of Skull Rock, which has remained a mystery for years. After the main quest was completed, a shift occurred just off Dazzle Beach, but aside from that, we didn’t know what was inside, or rather, who was inside. Now, as part of the Mysteries of Skull Rock update, we know the new character, Peter Pan, lies in wait for us. So, if you’re looking to unlock him, here’s exactly how to do it. Once you’ve completed the Mysteries of Skull Rock update, you’ll need to wait until the A Forgotten Name quest comes up. We had to wait 45 minutes for the quest to arrive, so you’ll have to be a little patient. Once it pops up, you’ll be instructed to speak to The Forgotten, who will reveal they found a mysterious feather by Skull Rock. Naturally, the two of you investigate. Head over to Skull Rock and speak to The Forgotten there. You’ll both reminisce on better, freer times as a child before they ask you to give them a real name. Simply choose from one of the options or select a custom name. When you do, they’ll be added to your Valley as an official villager, marking the start of the next quest. Disney Dreamlight Valley Tea Sandwiches recipe & how to make it The next quest is Shadows On The Wall, which will have you heading into Skull Rock with The Forgotten (we’ll call them that for now because no one will know who Suzie is!). So, enter the new space and take in the beautiful boat. You’ll be told to explore Skull Rock, which is a not-so-subtle hint to check out the location for chests, hidden items, and the occasional piece of gem or gold coins. Once you’re satisfied, head over to The Forgotten and speak to them. They’ll explain that they saw a few Pixie Dust Orbs, which act as lights filled with Pixie Dust and Dreamlight. If you’ve found the lantern, then it’ll activate, and you’ll need to find the others. If not, you’ll be instructed to search more to find three broken lanterns to house the Pixie Dust Orbs. The first is found near where you speak to The Forgotten for the second time, by the Winches. Head to the far left corner facing The Forgotten and dig up the shining mound for the first Lantern. Then, head down to the ship and grab your Fishing Rod. The other two lanterns are on either side of the dock and need to be fished up. When you have all three, you’ll need the following ingredients to fix the Lanterns: As we mentioned above, you’ll find the lanterns in Skull Rock. The Gold Ingots are mined at mining nodes in Sunlit Plateau, Frosted Heights, and Forgotten Lands. It’s five Gold Nuggets per Ingot, so you’ll need 15 Gold Nuggets and three Coal. Glass is crafted using Sand, which is dug up in Dazzle Beach. You’ll need 45 Sand and 18 Coal to make nine Glass. Lastly, Vitalys Crystals are mined in the Vitalys Mine in the Sunlit Plateau. Next, you’ll need to catch the three Orbs. We found them in the following locations: With that, head to a crafting table and go to Functional Items. Then craft the three Pixie Dust Lanterns. Next, head back to Skull Rock and place them on all three Winches. The Winches will be coming out of the ground near The Forgotten. When you’ve created all the Winches, you’ll need to line up all three in one place to catch the Shadow. For this, aim them all at the longer wall on the right, when looking at The Forgotten. When they’re pointed out, you can introduce yourself to the Shadow, who will try and show you something. Move one of the lights to free him and aim them at the Winch on the wall behind where you spoke to the Shadow. You only need two lights on it, as a third will trap him. Once you’ve done this, speak to the three Jade Skulls and solve the three riddles using the following answers: With that, you’ll be able to turn the winch and continue onto the next quest. Next, follow the Shadow and The Forgotten through the gate and speak to The Forgotten. You’ll need to look for another Winch, which is found buried in a rock by the barrel to your right. Use your pickaxe and break the rock to reveal a Pixie Dust Orb, some Pixie Dust, and the winch. You’ll need to follow the Pixie Dust Orb around Skull Rock, collecting all the Pixie Dust it drops. Follow it as it glides and use your pickaxe on every large rock you come across. Some blend in well with the wall, so keep your pickaxe equipped. Once you’ve collected all six Pixie Dusts and the Pixie Dust Orb, which can be captured at the end of the task, you’ll need to make something fly. This is the large Pirate Ship situated in the middle of Skull Rock. Simply interact with it, add in the six Pixie Dust, and watch it fly. You’ll need to head up there and walk across the boat to speak to The Forgotten again. They’ll explain that these barrels are pretty mysterious and look to be part of a puzzle. You need to match the symbols to one another. Each pair is on opposite sides to each other, so it’ll be easy to make them face the correct answer.  The answers have been listed below: Simply line these up to face each other, and the puzzle will be solved. As a reward, you’ll receive the Captain’s key from the barrel behind The Forgotten. Pick it up and head down to the Captain’s Cabin on the bottom floor of the ship.  Once inside, you’ll see the Winch. Grab this and head back to where you picked up the key. There will be a slot for you to place the Winch down and open up the next section, therefore completing this current quest. For the final quest to unlock Peter Pan, follow The Forgotten and the Shadow to the next location in Skull Rock. What will appear is a series of musical notes and a book. Once you speak to The Forgotten, a Glowing Musical Note will break free and begin flying away. Chase after it and interact to catch the pesky note. If you lose sight of the note, head to the left after speaking to the Forgotten, it’ll go down the ramp and through the door. Left behind is a memory depicting Peter Pan flying with notes around him.  Next, head back to The Forgotten and pick up the silver key just to the left of them. Head back to the Captain’s Cabin and unlock the chest inside. What comes out is another memory in the form of a letter. This letter is a treasure map, with an X on Ariel’s Island. Speak to The Forgotten, and they’ll explain that you need to find this buried treasure and the Musical Notes. The clue you get for the Notes’ location is “the Forgotten Lands, the Frosted Heights, Dazzle Beach, and the Dream Castle.” Though if you’d rather, the answers they’re below. You can find the five extra notes in the following locations: As for the buried treasure, you’ll need to take the boat by Skull Rock to Ariel’s island. It’s just on the curve. Dig up the treasure, and that task will be complete. Then, head back to The Forgotten and the Musical Notes. You’ll need to interact with the individual buttons to move the notes up. Make sure they align with the notes in the book, which is shown in the image below. Annoyingly, the Shadow will sabotage this, so you’ll need to craft one more Lantern in the crafting table on the right and place it on the Winch. Then, move them both into the middle to trap him. Lastly, move the notes back to their rightful positions. With that, Peter Pan will appear and allow you to speak to him. He’s a little cautious since you’re an adult, so he will challenge you to a game of hide-and-seek. You’re looking for dark, scary spots when searching for Peter Pan. It’s up to you whether you want to follow the Pixie Dust or ask the villagers where he might be. But, if you prefer to just unlock him, then you’ll find him in the following location: Head into the portal in the Plaza and enter the Dark Castle. Go up as much as possible, and you’ll find plenty of Pixie dust and eventually Peter Pan himself. With that, he’ll agree to join your Valley. So, place down his home, build it for 20,000 Star Coins, and he’ll be invited to your Valley. For Peter Pan’s first Friendship Quest, Shadow Tag, you’ll have to catch Peter’s shadow and sew it back onto him. The first step is having a word with Minnie and check her house for Peter Pan’s shadow.  To find Peter shadow’s in Minnie’s house, look for a red lamp next to Minnie’s bed and interact with it. After a cutscene, you’ll be asked to craft a Shadow Spotlight. To craft the Shadow Spotlight, you’ll need the following ingredients: Once you’ve got the ingredients, head to the nearest crafting station and look for this recipe under Functional Items. The next steps will be to speak with Sally and Beast. In Beast’s house, place the Shadow Spotlights on the sparkling spots on the red carpet. Then, just watch as Kristoff sews Peter’s shadow onto him. For Peter Pan’s second Friendship Quest, you’ll be asked to cook several meals, starting with a five-star Entrée. Any 5-star Entrée will do, but here are a few ideas: Once you’re done cooking, bring it back to him. Unforunately, this refined dish won’t be on par with Peter’s taste. After consulting with Sully and Remy, they suggest you make French Fries and a Peanut Butter Sandwitch. Bring these meals back to Peter Pan; he’ll be slightly more pleased with these. The next step is to help him clean his Trash Piles. You’ll eventually run into an Old Swing. Show it to Peter to evoke a memory of three locations, this is where he lost some of his treasures. If you take a look at the memory that dropped on the ground, we can deduce the treasures are in the following locations: Once you’ve found all three treasures, return them to Peter to complete a Real Hideout. For Peter Pan’s third Friendship Quest, we’ll be cooking nine pies, then cleaning a bunch of houses, and running auditions for the next Lost Boys. Let’s review each recipe you’ll need to cook. Keep in mind, you’ll need three of each ingredient for every recipe. When you’re done with all this cooking, bring the pies to Peter. He unfortunately won’t just be eating them like a good boy, but will use them to pie Donald, Merlin, and Scar’s houses… which you’ll have to clean up. All this cleaning up is followed by a heart of heart with Peter, in which he reveals he’s missing his Lost Boys. To help him find interested candidates, you’ll have to craft some signs. To craft five of these signs, you’ll need When ready, head to the nearest crafting station and craft the Lost Boys Audition Signs. Then, place them around the Valley and meet up with Peter at his house to be part of the audition process. After he’s assembled his team, the quest will be over. For Peter Pan’s fourth Friendship Quest, we’ll be facing the most fearsome evil pirate: Eric the Meek. Eric is hiding in the Secret Chamber in the Frosted Heights. Head inside, mine the ice clumps blocking the way, and have a word with him. He’ll then ask that you gather 5 Minerals and 10 Gold Nuggets to bribe the First Mate. Next, head to the Forgotten Lands and had inside the treehouse to enter the Dreamscape. In here, you’ll find the Fairy Godmother, who’ll take your bribe and wave you goodbye, perhaps with a bit too much kindness. The final scene of this quest takes place where this whole adventure started: in Skull Rock. The first guard you’ll have to bypass is Ariel. Funnily enough, it’s harder to reach her than to bypass her. In any case, grab the pickaxe and destroy the rocks blocking the way and have a word with her. Then, the real challenge begins. Avoid being detected by the lanterns After getting the key and opening the treasure, head outside of Skull Rock and place it on the Valley to take a celebratory selfie with the team.

Today the review embargo lifts on the Framework Laptop 12 and thus can share our initial impressions on this Intel-powered 12-inch laptop.  The Framework Laptop 12 is a 12.2-inch convertible laptop with touchscreen support and optional stylus whether you want to treat it as a mini Linux laptop or as needed convert to a Linux tablet. Windows 11 remains, of course, supported but all of my testing the past week and a half has been under Linux: predominantly Ubuntu 25.04 but also Fedora Workstation 42.  The Framework Laptop 12 is upgrade-friendly with modular/replaceable hardware just like what we have come to enjoy out of the Framework Laptop 13 and Framework Laptop 16 models. But unlike the larger laptops is in a 2-in-1 convertible design with a 360-degree hinge.  The build quality on the Framework Laptop 12 is very nice and complies with MIL-STD-810 durability standards. It's not too thick yet not too thin and is the right balance of portability and durability. In fact, one of the better feeling convertible devices I have tested over the years at Phoronix.  The Framework Laptop 12 components are replaceable from the motherboard to the single channel RAM, WiFi, battery, and other components. Plus all of the I/O ports are replaceable too just like the other Framework Laptop models.  From a build quality and upgrade perspective, the Framework Laptop 12 is a very nice and rugged convertible laptop. Let's move on to talking more about the performance characteristics and capabilities of the Framework Laptop 12.

Then, they'll receive a personalized training plan geared toward their goal of completing a 5K, 10K, half, or full marathon.  The feature resembles Apple Watch's Workout Buddy, which Apple released last week during its annual developers conference. Workout Buddy provides encouragement and aggregates fitness data before, during, and after a user's exercise session.  Your Galaxy Watch is now going to tell you when it's time to go to bed. Bedtime Guidance analyzes your past three days of sleep to determine the best time to go to sleep every night. It takes into account ""need for sleep pressure"" and circadian rhythm to create a sleep schedule that works for the Galaxy Watch wearer.  Samsung says this feature is great for those with irregular sleep patterns.  How stressed is your heart while you sleep? Samsung's Vascular Load feature will tell you.  Several factors impact a heart's ability to dip during the night and initiate recovery. Stress, that is, a higher heart rate, should decrease during sleep, and a higher heart rate throughout the night could signal overall poorer cardiovascular health, Samsung says in the press release.  Vascular Load measures a user's heart rate throughout the night and uses the insights it gains through exercise and stress data during the day to encourage healthier habits and lifestyle changes.  Certain activities and behaviors can inhibit recovery and fitness progress. Alcohol, smoking, UV exposure, stress, and poor sleep are a few of the factors that Samsung claims accelerate aging and increase free radicals. The solution? Antioxidants, Samsung says.  Samsung's Antioxidant Index measures antioxidants found in green and orange fruits and vegetables (known as carotenoids). The brand says that these carotenoids promote healthy aging.  Also: The best blood pressure watches you can buy: Expert tested The feature is activated when a user places the center of their finger on the Galaxy Watch's light-activated BioActive sensor, which can take the Antioxidant Index within five seconds. Samsung recommends using a thumb on the sensor for the most accurate results.  Looking for the next best product?

"16 Billion Apple, Facebook, Google And Other Passwords Leaked — Act Now",Change all your account passwords now — don't wait: 16 billion credentials are confirmed as having been leaked.,"{'thumbnail': 'https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVRTMnhtUjFGWGRtNXVkVTVhVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdrTllZNEl0V1ZFaXdJ=-w280-h168-p-df-rw', 'thumbnailProxied': 'https://img.devisty.store/newsimage/CC8iL0NnNVRTMnhtUjFGWGRtNXVkVTVhVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdrTllZNEl0V1ZFaXdJ'}",False,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/06/18/16-billion-apple-facebook-google-passwords-leaked---change-yours-now/,Forbes,"ByDavey Winder  ByDavey Winder,  Senior Contributor.  The biggest password leak in history confirmed. If you thought that my May 23 report, confirming the leak of login data totaling an astonishing 184 million compromised credentials, was frightening, I hope you are sitting down now. Researchers have just confirmed what is also certainly the largest data breach ever, with an almost incredulous 16 billion login credentials, including passwords, exposed. As part of an ongoing investigation that started at the beginning of the year, the researchers have postulated that the massive password leak is the work of multiple infostealers. Here’s what you need to know and do. Password compromise is no joke; it leads to account compromise and that leads to, well, the compromise of most everything you hold dear in this technological-centric world we live in. It’s why Google is telling billions of users to replace their passwords with much secure passkeys. It’s why the FBI is warning people not to click on links in SMS messages. It’s why stolen passwords are up for sale, in their millions, on the dark web to anyone with the very little amount of cash required to purchase them. And it’s why this latest revelation is, frankly, so darn concerning for everyone. According to Vilius Petkauskas at Cybernews, whose researchers have been investigating the leakage since the start of the year, “30 exposed datasets containing from tens of millions to over 3.5 billion records each,” have been discovered. In total, Petkauskas has confirmed, the number of compromised records has now hit 16 billion. Let that sink in for a bit. These collections of login credentials, these databases stuffed full of compromised passwords, comprise what is thought to be the largest such leak in history. The 16 billion strong leak, housed in a number ion supermassive datasets, includes billions of login credentials from social media, VPNs, developer portals and user accounts for all the major vendors. Remarkably, I am told that none of these datasets have been reported as leaked previously, this is all new data. Well, almost none: the 184 million password database I mentioned at the start of the article is the only exception. “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation,” the researchers said. And they are right. These credentials are ground zero for phishing attacks and account takeover. “These aren’t just old breaches being recycled,” they warned, “this is fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.” Most of that intelligence was structured in the format of a URL, followed by login details and a password. The information contained, the researchers stated, open the door to “pretty much any online service imaginable, from Apple, Facebook, and Google, to GitHub, Telegram, and various government services.” Ultimately, this reinforces that cybersecurity is not just a technical challenge but a shared responsibility. “Organisations need to do their part in protecting users,” Javvad Malik, lead security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said, “and people need to remain vigilant and mindful of any attempts to steal login credentials. Choose strong and unique passwords, and implement multi factor authentication wherever possible."" To which I would add: change your account passwords, use a password manager and switch to passkeys wherever possible. Now is the time to take this seriously, don’t wait until your passwords show up in these ongoing leak datasets – get on top of your password security right now.",16 Billion Apple Facebook Google And Other Passwords Leaked Act NowChange all your account passwords now dont wait 16 billion credentials are confirmed as having been leakedByDavey Winder ByDavey Winder Senior Contributor The biggest password leak in history confirmed If you thought that my May 23 report confirming the leak of login data totaling an astonishing 184 million compromised credentials was frightening I hope you are sitting down now Researchers have just confirmed what is also certainly the largest data breach ever with an almost incredulous 16 billion login credentials including passwords exposed As part of an ongoing investigation that started at the beginning of the year the researchers have postulated that the massive password leak is the work of multiple infostealers Heres what you need to know and do Password compromise is no joke it leads to account compromise and that leads to well the compromise of most everything you hold dear in this technologicalcentric world we live in Its why Google is telling billions of users to replace their passwords with much secure passkeys Its why the FBI is warning people not to click on links in SMS messages Its why stolen passwords are up for sale in their millions on the dark web to anyone with the very little amount of cash required to purchase them And its why this latest revelation is frankly so darn concerning for everyone According to Vilius Petkauskas at Cybernews whose researchers have been investigating the leakage since the start of the year 30 exposed datasets containing from tens of millions to over 35 billion records each have been discovered In total Petkauskas has confirmed the number of compromised records has now hit 16 billion Let that sink in for a bit These collections of login credentials these databases stuffed full of compromised passwords comprise what is thought to be the largest such leak in history The 16 billion strong leak housed in a number ion supermassive datasets includes billions of login credentials from social media VPNs developer portals and user accounts for all the major vendors Remarkably I am told that none of these datasets have been reported as leaked previously this is all new data Well almost none the 184 million password database I mentioned at the start of the article is the only exception This is not just a leak its a blueprint for mass exploitation the researchers said And they are right These credentials are ground zero for phishing attacks and account takeover These arent just old breaches being recycled they warned this is fresh weaponizable intelligence at scale Most of that intelligence was structured in the format of a URL followed by login details and a password The information contained the researchers stated open the door to pretty much any online service imaginable from Apple Facebook and Google to GitHub Telegram and various government services Ultimately this reinforces that cybersecurity is not just a technical challenge but a shared responsibility Organisations need to do their part in protecting users Javvad Malik lead security awareness advocate at KnowBe4 said and people need to remain vigilant and mindful of any attempts to steal login credentials Choose strong and unique passwords and implement multi factor authentication wherever possible To which I would add change your account passwords use a password manager and switch to passkeys wherever possible Now is the time to take this seriously dont wait until your passwords show up in these ongoing leak datasets get on top of your password security right now

Samsung’s Android XR headset was first revealed in late 2024, and the company hasn’t been shy about showing it off in the months since. We’ve seen the headset at in-person events such as the Galaxy S25 launch and Mobile World Congress, while also seeing a live demo in recent months. The headset has constantly been said to be coming “later this year,” but without a specific date. Now, we’re finally getting something to narrow that down. Korean publication Newspim reports that Samsung will fully unveil “Project Moohan” – also referred to in the post as “Project Infinite,” which is what “Moohan” can translate to – at an Unpacked event on September 29 in its home country of South Korea. The headset would then go on sale in the country on October 13, and roll out to the global market after that. Ahead of this, the report says that Samsung will show off prototypes of the “Moohan” headset as well as show teaser videos during its Unpacked event for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 in July, though it’s unclear if the company will tease a release date at that time. The release of “Project Moohan” has certainly been a long time coming, but it’s nice to know we finally have a timeline to look forward to. Are you excited for the first Android XR headset?

If you'd like to do the same, here's your guide to installing iOS 26 today.
   The iOS 26 developer beta is nearly here. Apple wrapped up WWDC 25 last week and then dropped the first developer beta of iOS 26. This early release gives developers (and the most impatient enthusiasts) their first hands-on encounter with features and settings the company previewed on stage at Apple Park: a major redesign and AI upgrades for the iPhone software. The biggest new feature is Liquid Glass, Apple's new cohesive design language across all its devices, with a transparent, lenslike aesthetic. Live Translation is integrated into Messages and FaceTime to help you communicate across languages. Call Screening, an evolution of Live Voicemail, picks up unknown numbers on your behalf, asks why callers are calling and shows a live transcript so you can decide whether to jump in or let it roll to voicemail. Its sidekick, Hold Assist, listens to the hold music for you and pings you the instant a real person comes on the line. And there's a lot more. By jumping straight from iOS 18 to iOS 26, Apple is syncing its mobile OS naming with the rest of its platforms and signaling a generational leap rather than the usual annual tune-up. It's the biggest OS update since iOS 7, with updates and enhancements to pretty much every part of the iPhone. If you want to try out any of these features, you can do so right now. Here's how you can download iOS 26. Yes, the iOS 26 developer beta is free, but remember it's meant for developers, not day-to-day use. Early builds often carry bugs that can crash apps, drain your battery, overheat your phone and generally make your device feel sluggish. Unless you need to test software against Apple's next release, it's smarter to stick with the public beta, which will be released next month, on your main iPhone. The iPhone 17, when it's announced, will support iOS 26. As long as you own an iPhone 11 or newer, you can download iOS 26. That means the iPhone XR/XS generation is out, while every A13 Bionic handset forward, including the forthcoming iPhone 17 models, are included. Here's the full list of compatible iPhone models that can run iOS 26: Apple Intelligence works only on compatible phones, which include any iPhone 16 model and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Before you get too excited and start installing the iOS 26 developer beta, there are a few things you need to do: Once you've followed these steps, you're pretty much ready to go. Apple now lets anyone install developer betas without paying the $99 annual fee. To do so, visit the Apple Developer site on the device you plan to update, open the ☰ menu, choose Account, and sign in with that device's Apple ID. Agree to the terms, tick the required boxes, and tap Submit. You may also need to enable Developer Mode in Settings > Privacy and Security. Now you can install the iOS 26 developer beta on your phone as an over-the-air update: The iOS 26 developer beta is 15.28GB in size. Finally, punch in your passcode, accept the T&C, and let the installer do its thing. On a decent Wi-Fi connection, the download-and-reboot routine should take roughly 10 to 15 minutes, but that may vary.

New Linux Flaws Enable Full Root Access via PAM and Udisks Across Major Distributions,Linux systems face critical local privilege escalation threats via CVE-2025-6018/6019 flaws—users must patch now.,,False,https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/new-linux-flaws-enable-full-root-access.html,The Hacker News,"Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered two local privilege escalation (LPE) flaws that could be exploited to gain root privileges on machines running major Linux distributions. The vulnerabilities, discovered by Qualys, are listed below - ""These modern 'local-to-root' exploits have collapsed the gap between an ordinary logged-in user and a full system takeover,"" Saeed Abbasi, Senior Manager at Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), said. ""By chaining legitimate services such as udisks loop-mounts and PAM/environment quirks, attackers who own any active GUI or SSH session can vault across polkit's allow_active trust zone and emerge as root in seconds."" The cybersecurity company said CVE-2025-6018 is present in the PAM configuration of openSUSE Leap 15 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, enabling an unprivileged local attacker to elevate to the ""allow_active"" user and call Polkit actions that are otherwise reserved for a physically present user. CVE-2025-6019, on the other hand, affects libblockdev and is exploitable via the udisks daemon included by default on most Linux distributions. It essentially permits an ""allow_active"" user to gain full root privileges by chaining it with CVE-2025-6018. ""Although it nominally requires 'allow_active' privileges, udisks ships by default on almost all Linux distributions, so nearly any system is vulnerable,"" Abbasi added. ""Techniques to gain 'allow_active,' including the PAM issue disclosed here, further negate that barrier."" Once root privileges are obtained, an attacker has carte blanche access to the system, allowing them use it as a springboard for broader post-compromise actions, such as altering security controls and implanting backdoors for covert access. Qualys said it has developed proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to confirm the presence of these vulnerabilities on various operating systems, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE Leap 15. To mitigate the risk posed by these flaws, it's essential to apply patches provided by the Linux distribution vendors. As temporary workarounds, users can modify the Polkit rule for ""org.freedesktop.udisks2.modify-device"" to require administrator authentication (""auth_admin""). The disclosure comes as maintainers of Linux PAM resolved a high-severity path traversal flaw (CVE-2025-6020, CVSS score: 7.8) that could also allow a local user to escalate to root privileges. The issue has been fixed in version 1.7.1. ""The module pam_namespace in linux-pam <= 1.7.0 may access user-controlled paths without proper protections, which allows a local user to elevate their privileges to root via multiple symlink attacks and race conditions,"" Linux PAM maintainer Dmitry V. Levin said. Linux systems are vulnerable if they use pam_namespace to set up polyinstantiated directories for which the path to either the polyinstantiated directory or instance directory is under user-control. As workarounds for CVE-2025-6020, users can disable pam_namespace or ensure it does not operate on user-controlled paths. ANSSI's Olivier Bal-Petre, who reported the flaw to the maintainer on January 29, 2025, said users should also update their namespace.init script if they do not use the one provided by their distribution to ensure that the either of two paths are safe to operate on as root.

Adobe Is Developing AI-Powered Culling Tools for Lightroom,"Adobe is bringing new AI-powered tools to Lightroom and Photoshop, including a highly-requested culling feature.","{'thumbnail': 'https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNDNWVmxXUjNOUk9HNUdZV2hPVFJDaUFSaTJBaWdCTWdrSmNKUWJyQ2RrNndF=-w280-h168-p-df-rw', 'thumbnailProxied': 'https://img.devisty.store/newsimage/CC8iL0NnNDNWVmxXUjNOUk9HNUdZV2hPVFJDaUFSaTJBaWdCTWdrSmNKUWJyQ2RrNndF'}",False,https://petapixel.com/2025/06/17/adobe-is-developing-ai-powered-culling-tools-for-lightroom/,PetaPixel,"Adobe announced new features across much of the Creative Cloud ecosystem, including in Lightroom and Photoshop, designed to help creators move even faster from idea to final delivery. Adobe promises that its latest updates deliver “speed, precision, and smarter AI to power your workflow.”  Starting first with Lightroom enhancements on Lightroom on mobile (iOS and Android) and Lightroom for web. Users can now tap on a new Quick Actions item, “Scene Enhance,” to instantly improve their landscape photos. Scene Enhance promises to accurately detect outdoor elements in photos, including the sky, water, ground, and more, to apply intelligent edits to each segment precisely.   Traditional desktop Lightroom users are not left out of the fun. Adobe’s previously previewed Reflection Removal tool is now available to all users of Lightroom, Lightroom Classic, Lightroom on mobile (iOS and Android), Lightroom for web, and Adobe Camera Raw. First shown off last December, the new feature uses AI to detect and erase unwanted reflections from glass in photos. If users want to preserve some reflections, that’s possible, too, thanks to a strength slider.   A new one-click people and distraction removal tool built into Generative Remove can now detect people who are not the subject of a photo and instantly remove them from the frame in a single click. “It’s a simple and fast way to clean up your shot without having to make meticulous selections,” Adobe writes.  Adobe has also teased a highly-requested new feature coming to Lightroom and Lightroom Classic that will help photographers quickly locate their best photos.  “We’re building filters like subject focus, eyes focus, and eyes open detection to support your creative decision-making process and speed up your review time,” Adobe writes. “You’ll also have the ability to use AI-assisted options to clean up unwanted images, or group similar images together, so you can stay organized and get to editing faster.”  If this feature works as advertised, it could be a massive time-saver for photographers, especially event and wedding photographers who have to go through thousands of photos from each job. It will work both during import and when organizing an existing catalog. Its precise release date is unknown, but Adobe typically does not show tools off too long before they are ready for at least a public beta test.  Over in Photoshop, Adobe has added Dynamic Text to help creators easily place, resize, and reformat type to fit any bounding box. This also includes additional settings that provide fine-grained control over spacing “for pixel-perfect typography.”  More exciting for photographers is improved Select Subject and Remove Background performance thanks to enhanced cloud-powered processing. Select Subject and Remove Background promise to be much faster and more precise, thanks to the improved processing power on offer.  Alongside the Lightroom and Photoshop updates, Adobe also announced improvements to Adobe Illustrator, including adding Generative Expand to the illustration app, and Firefly, which now features Firefly Boards, a concept storyboard platform available for Creative Cloud Pro subscribers.

"We compare Raidou Remastered on Switch 2, Steam Deck, Switch 1, & ROG Ally covering visuals and performance","Our new feature has Raidou Remastered Switch vs Switch 2 compared including backward compatibility and also the PC port on Steam Deck LCD, Steam Deck OLED,...","{'thumbnail': 'https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHhURnBKYmtOUVZHNXFhMmQzVFJDMEFoampCeWdLTWdhUk1ZektJUWc=-w280-h168-p-df-rw', 'thumbnailProxied': 'https://img.devisty.store/newsimage/CC8iK0NnNHhURnBKYmtOUVZHNXFhMmQzVFJDMEFoampCeWdLTWdhUk1ZektJUWc'}",False,https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/17744-raidou-remastered-switch-2-vs-switch-vs-steam-deck-pc-port-best-version-rog-ally,RPG Site,"Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is now available on consoles and PC and despite it being called a remaster, it feels more like a remake of Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army. While I already posted some impressions from a preview build of the game last month, I've since played the final build across multiple platforms. This includes the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Steam versions. For my testing, I've played the Switch version on my Nintendo Switch OLED and Nintendo Switch 2 via backward compatibility, the native Nintendo Switch 2 release on Nintendo Switch 2, and the Steam release across my Steam Deck LCD, Steam Deck OLED, and ROG Ally.  I specifically also wanted to test the Switch version played on Switch 2 since I know some folks are curious about it given the lack of an upgrade path and also because the Switch 2 release is a Game Key Card release. For this feature, I'm also focusing on the portable experience, but I will have some impressions for docked play. The aim is to help you decide which is the best portable version of Raidou Remastered for you.  While Atlus revealed some technical details  for Raidou Remastered across platforms, those don't tell the whole story for Nintendo platforms at least based on my testing. Those Raidou Remastered resolution and frame rate targets had me confused because the Switch 2 version was listed as having no advantage when played docked. Having now spent a few hours with all these versions, there clearly is a difference which I will get to. I've also had to retest the Switch and Switch 2 versions to verify that nothing has changed with the day one patches.  Raidou Remastered on Switch (1), tested with the latest update which is version 1.02, is a bit of a mixed bag right now. It can hold 60fps in some areas, but generally feels unstable with subnative image quality both docked (on a 1080p display) and handheld. There is also a lot of aliasing so expect shimmering during movement for 3D elements in the environment. Atlus said the Switch version should be 720 and 1080 with 30-60fps performance with slowdown.  The latter seems accurate given the unstable frame rate with drops whenever things get busy with particle effects during combat or even during exploration when many NPCs or enemies are on screen, but the image quality does not look good enough. The UI and menus are all crisp on the Switch display, but the actual 3D gameplay looks softer than expected on Switch. The unstable frame rate also makes it feel like some NPCs animate at a lower frame rate, but this is just because of how much the frame rate can vary during gameplay and exploration. With context from the Switch version of Raidou Remastered, I was curious to see how the native Switch 2 version (with its latest update which is version 1.02) and even the Switch 1 version felt on Switch 2. For this, I had both installed to my Switch 2's internal storage. Raidou Remastered's Switch 2 release runs a lot better and feels very stable almost across the board. There are some instances where I noticed some hitching during exploration, but I think any drops don't feel bad enough to be a detriment like they are on Switch 1 or even Steam Deck which I will cover below. Visually, there is a difference between Raidou Remastered on Switch 2 played docked and handheld. I have no way to capture handheld or docked beyond the Switch 2's own capture solution, but when playing them and comparing side by side, docked looks better with a more stable image compared to handheld where there is more shimmering and it looks a bit softer than expected in parts. This is still a big upgrade over the Switch 1 version though. Speaking of the Switch version on Switch 2, Raidou Remastered's performance is very good across both versions, and I know this was something many were curious about given that only the Switch version of Raidou Remastered has a physical release while the Switch 2 version is a Game Key Card. The slight hitching I mentioned before for the Switch 2 version is also present in the Switch version when played via backward compatibility.  The Switch 2 version, while better visually than Switch 1, still has some minor aliasing unfortunately. This causes shimmering in some 3D elements during movement. It isn't a huge issue, but it is noticeable. I ended up playing more of Raidou Remastered on Switch 2 in portable mode given how good it looked and felt overall compared to other versions.  In terms of visuals and performance, the Switch 2 version is the clear winner. While you can brute force the Switch version to get a better frame rate that hits 60fps much more often and feels good, the visual cutback is not great. I recommend getting the Switch 2 version to play on Switch 2, but if you see yourself wanting to play on both systems or even own a Switch 2 and a Switch Lite, the Switch 1 version might be a better purchase for you, physical release also considered.  When I wrote my impressions from the PC preview build, I mentioned how the game on Steam Deck had a weird issue where the performance in a few areas stuck around the 40-45fps regardless of the settings I used. I hoped that the full game would address these, but it is sadly still present, albeit to a lesser degree. I have to assume that this is specific to Proton/SteamOS since the game runs fine on ROG Ally and the Steam Deck can't even hit 60fps in those instances when running at the absolute lowest resolution and settings. I hope this can be addressed around launch since the game is otherwise fantastic on Steam Deck.  I ran into said issue on both my Steam Decks. My Steam Deck OLED is on the latest public and stable OS update while the Steam Deck LCD is running the preview channel release. The performance issue was present on the default version of Proton, Proton Experimental (bleeding edge), and also GE Proton 10-3. Note that you should avoid swapping Proton versions to test this game too often since it uses Denuvo and you might get locked out of playing for some time. I had that happen with prior games that use Denuvo DRM. This also means you will need to be online when you first boot up the game and if you try playing it after a while. In its current state, I cannot recommend playing Raidou Remastered on Steam Deck unless you're ok with a 40-60fps experience on the Steam Deck LCD and a 40-90fps experience on the Steam Deck OLED. It is marked as Steam Deck Playable by Valve with Steam Cloud support, but it is sadly not great right now.  As of this writing, I recommend playing on the prioritize graphics preset and capping the frame rate to 40fps on both Steam Deck LCD and OLED. Regardless of the settings used, I was unable to get the game to run at 60fps consistently in specific areas. I imagine Valve will step in to fix this like it did with Persona 3 Reload on Steam Deck if Atlus does not because Sega and Atlus games get shown off on Steam Deck in promotion. I will be revisiting this after any potential updates from Valve or Sega that address these issues. As for the PC port itself, everything I said about the preview build also applies here. Raidou Remastered is not capped to 30fps like Nocturne HD was on PC. It even supports well above 60fps even on the ROG Ally. It will run at your monitor's refresh rate when you enable v-sync. When disabling it, Raidou Remastered targets 60fps.  The Raidou Remastered PC graphics settings are a bit bare-bones with a prioritize graphics or performance preset available. These seem to only change the rendering scale, shadows, and anti-aliasing. You can adjust the rendering scale (60, 80, and 100) and toggle both shadows and anti-aliasing on and off. There is no option to go above 100% render scale or change any additional settings. Given the lacking performance on Steam Deck in some situations, I was curious to see what was possible on the ROG Ally. My ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme) is set to use 5GB VRAM. When testing, I used the 25W and 30W modes. On the 30W mode using the prioritize graphics and rendering at a native 1080p, the frame rate held above 95fps at all times, but it did fluctuate a lot from 95 to 120 and the changes were noticeable.  I recommend playing at 1080p and aiming for a locked 60fps. This is achievable even at 15W with very minor dips that aren't noticeable thanks to VRR on the ROG Ally screen based on the few hours I replayed to test across different performance modes. Note that it is possible the frame doesn't hold up later on in the game, but it seems like ROG Ally can deliver a 60fps experience even at 15W. For this test, I decided to measure the time Raidou Remastered takes to get to the title screen from the dashboard or Steam Client. I made sure to mash the confirm button to speed up the process on all platforms as much as I could. I also tested how long each version took to load a save from the main menu. You might notice I have two times listed for the dashboard to title screen for the Steam Decks. This is because SteamOS itself takes 25 (or 28 seconds on the LCD model) to launch the game. The total time from pressing ""Play"" on the Steam Deck in game mode to getting to the title screen is 40 seconds on the OLED model and 42 seconds on the LCD model after 3 tests per model. The game was installed to the internal SSD in both cases. I'm not sure why it took this long to load on Steam Deck, but I verified across different Proton versions and on both my Steam Decks. I will be retesting this when the game has launched and I've moved to the public build of the game. Right now, the Switch 2 version alongside the Steam release played on ROG Ally for Raidou Remastered are my favorite portable experiences.The ROG Ally delivers crisper handheld visuals and a higher frame rate though, but the battery life is worse. If you own a ROG Ally X, that is going to be the best way to play Raidou Remastered on the go. The game on Steam Deck is sadly lacking right now with the performance and I have no idea what is causing those issues. The Switch 1 version played on Switch is definitely the worst of the versions I've played so far. If you play the Switch 1 version on Switch 2, the performance is massively better than playing on Switch 1, but the visuals are a step back in most ways.",We compare Raidou Remastered on Switch 2

It turns out Bandai Namco still has an eye for Japan Studio’s output, and so it’s single-handedly reviving the likes of Freedom Wars and Everybody’s Golf, under license of course. This new trailer offers an overview of its upcoming Patapon 1+2 Replay bundle, which features the first two titles from Sony’s seminal rhythm RPG series. Those of you who’ve already played these games won’t learn much new here, but some smart quality of life improvements have been incorporated, like difficulty settings and the ability to adjust the timing of the gameplay. (An important addition for those playing on potentially laggy displays.) Remember, this version of the game is coming to the Switch and PC as well, where it’ll likely find a larger audience due to the novelty of it expanding beyond PlayStation platforms.

He’s an expert on PS Studios and industry matters, as well as sports games and simulators. He also enjoys RPGs when he has the time to dedicate to them, and is a bit of a gacha whale. Comments 9  Sucks that Sony is significantly deprioritizing their smaller franchises, but at least they're licensing it to Bandai Namco, and it's nice that Patapon will be available on modern hardware. Hopefully this collection does well so that we can finally get a new Patapon movie game!  I tried the Patapon games through Ps+, but they just didn’t hook me like I thought they would. Maybe Bandai Namco will bring some new life to the series. That said, I really wish Sony would buy the rights to the Katamari games from Bandai Namco. I’d love to see a new entry in that series from a different perspective, and since Sony is so good with implementing their Dualsense haptic controller features into their games, it’d be a great series to do it with.  @jgrangervikings1 Imagine the Katamari franchise in the hands of Team Asobi 👍  It's a smart idea to release it on other platforms too, to help generate more sales and hopefully open the door for more revivals like this.  I owned Patapon 1 remastered and Patapon 2 on Vita. So i'm gonna stick with what i already have. But looking at Freedom Wars remaster very low sales, i doubt this remaster will sold well or even trigger Sony to make Patapon 4.  Another reason to dip in on a 3rd format!  I love this game back on the psp. Wishlist it on steam and of course going to play it on my deck oled. Revived my childhood memories 😆  @PuppetMaster From what I understand these seem to be relatively low effort ports/remasters and Freedom Wars was already a mixed reception game, I don't know what they thought would happen re-releasing it so close to the new Monster Hunter.  @Get2SammyB Welcome to the Hermen Hulst reign of Worldwide Studios wherein he greenlighted buying Bungie for billions, loving their ""expertise"" so much he let other Bungie staff be spun off to waste millions on likes of Concord etc.,(& buy those startups as separate entities too despite having zero track record of success), splurge on mobile devs & PC devs, but couldn't fund some specialist dev studios (or waste Bluepoint on a live service God of War themed title reportedly),to handle classic IP's or say port some PS3 era first party titles to modern day gens?! Maybe if he wasn't so besotted with playing favourites amongst Worldwide Studios, TV show spin offs & creating/finding his first party Fortnite pot of gold at the expense of ignoring a back catalogue of classic IP's they wouldn't be suffering the mismanagement they largely have this generation. It might’ve started under Jim Ryan appointing Hulst as his yes man,but how Hulst has remained is unfathomable. Shawn Layden or Shuhei Yoshida whom knew their PS Gaming history from obscure to major titles is a trait completely lacking in Hulst.

Dualsense haptic controller features into their games itd be a great series to do it with jgrangervikings1 Imagine the Katamari franchise in the hands of Team Asobi Its a smart idea to release it on other platforms too to help generate more sales and hopefully open the door for more revivals like this I owned Patapon 1 remastered and Patapon 2 on Vita So im gonna stick with what i already have But looking at Freedom Wars remaster very low sales i doubt this remaster will sold well or even trigger Sony to make Patapon 4 Another reason to dip in on a 3rd format I love this game back on the psp Wishlist it on steam and of course going to play it on my deck oled Revived my childhood memories PuppetMaster From what I understand these seem to be relatively low effort portsremasters and Freedom Wars was already a mixed reception game I dont know what they thought would happen rereleasing it so close to the new Monster Hunter Get2SammyB Welcome to the Hermen Hulst reign of Worldwide

Marathon Marathon isn’t cancelled. I do not believe Marathon is going to be cancelled. Even if yesterday, Bungie announced that Marathon would no longer hit its September 23, 2025 release date, with no new date given, that’s not what’s happening. The game is too far along and too important for both Bungie and Sony to just throw in the towel now. As such, Bungie has now written a list of what is being worked on during this Marathon delay period, and I thought it was a good time to go through and analyze each point. Let’s get going: More challenging and engaging AI encounters – This is something Bungie already touched on during the Alpha itself, testing out more intense enemy AI, and they reiterated that in the last livestream. A robust, more pervasive AI presence is something that could differentiate it from competitors and at least fulfill some PvE wishes from sections of its potential playerbase. We also have to remember more AI factions are coming, like the Pfhor, and they may be here by the new release date, perhaps. More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events – We were always getting “new types of loot” with the Alpha holding a lot back, but I’m wondering if this means things like extra high-end, special perk gear, or even something like new equipment slots. And more rewarding gear would perhaps help you to take more away even with shorter runs. More dynamic events could be things like weather or enemy drops or more things to engage with, like supply drops, all welcome. Making combat more tense and strategic – I very much take this as leaning into the harder core aspects of the extraction genre, moving away from feeling like a slower Apex Legends and more into “tactical” engagements. Bungie has touched on this already, talking about moving the gap between super-geared players and lower-geared players together so it’s less of an auto-stomp. Still, I do not take this as an effort to make the game more casual, but the opposite. Marathon FEATURED | Frase ByForbes™ Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder Increased visual fidelity – I mean, this one was obvious. The Alpha did not look great because it was unfinished, and a lot of stuff, mainly exteriors and player models, needed tons of work. I will be curious to see where it ends up. More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with – There is currently very little of this in the game at all. Most narrative is contained to some vendor conversations but on the maps themselves? Adding lore there would be nice. That said, it’s difficult to make dedicated PvP players care much about lore, and it’s likely not enough to drag PvE players in to experience it, is my guess. A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy – I’m a little confused about this one as I do think the lore we do have is dark and has themes of the original trilogy. The main complaint about Marathon not feeling like “Marathon” is the fact that it looks and plays completely different and is an entirely different genre of game, which I can’t imagine changing. And you’re not going to make it look like that image three paragraphs above this, certainly. Marathon A better player experience for solos/duos – Possibly the biggest complaint about Marathon to date has been that there is no dedicated solos playlist, meaning you have to load in by yourself against teams of threes. However, the way this is phrased does not at all confirm that’s what’s coming. Rather, Bungie did already talk about making it feel better to be solo or duo in a game. Maybe they will make solos or duos playlists, but that is not what this is necessarily saying. Prox chat, so social stories can come to life – Everyone was pretty stunned when they realized that Bungie was making an extraction shooter without proximity chat, which is an obvious staple of the franchise. I am willing to bet the issue here was some sort of thing with Sony, given how its other games don’t have the feature either, and I don’t think it’s really a technical issue. Still, it’s allegedly coming. I remain skeptical this is as big a draw for Marathon as people make out, given how it will function in its non-Tarkov combat loop, but yes, obviously, the game should have the option, at least. I’m trying to be a bit more positive here than normal, but I’m not changing my ultimate conclusion that all this won’t be enough. We’ll see. Follow me on Twitter, YouTube, Bluesky and Instagram.

     Scoring a huge deal on Apple’s top-rated AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds is a matter of timing. There’s a 32% off deal that drops on Amazon which brings the price of these state of the art earbuds down to just $169, but you have to keep a sharp eye out for it. Or, better yet, we can just tell you when it’s back. Like right now. This $80 price drop on the AirPods Pro 2 hadn’t been around for the past month before now, but with the exception of the small Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2024 window when the AirPods Pro 2 dropped to a record low $154, this elusive $169 deal is the lowest price on Apple’s best-ever AirPods since they were released in April 2024. See at Amazon What’s earned the AirPods Pro 2 that stellar 4.6-star rating from nearly 30,000 Amazon reviewers, and all of those professional reviews calling them Apple’s best AirPods yet? Start with the new H2 chip that drives all of the many great features of the AirPods Pro 2. The state of the art H2 processor makes it all possible: the adaptive noice cancellation that intelligently detects the noise level of your surroundings, the transparency mode that lets in enough of your surroundings to keep you safe, and the vastly improved sound and call quality. Tack on the 6-hour battery life, seamless linking with Apple’s Find My with Precision Finding app to keep your AirPods Pro 2 secure, IP54-level dust, sweat, and water resistance, and the new ability to recharge with the Apple Watch charger in addition to USB-C, MagSafe, and other Qi-certified chargers, and those rave reviews make total sense. Perhaps most impressively, the AirPods Pro 2 come with hearing health support that’s a first in any mass-market earbuds. This includes a hearing test that allows you to check your hearing without a trip to the doctor’s office, hearing protection for when you’re in loud environments, and a clinical-grade hearing aid feature that assists people with mild to moderate hearing loss. There’s no predicting when that Amazon deal that drops the price of the AirPods Pro 2 from $249 to just $169. But when it does swing around â like right now â it’s more than worth jumping on. You get the industry-leading AirPods Pro 2 with all of their upgrades and advanced features, not to mention the pristine sound and peerless performance when you’re using them to take or make a phone call, and you get $80 back in your pocket.

Using your device security instead of a password makes it harder to get tricked into giving up your Facebook account. Facebook is adding support for passkeys on its mobile app. That means you’ll be able to log into the platform using your device’s authentication method, like your fingerprint, face scan, or PIN, making it more difficult for bad actors to take control of your account. Passkeys offer a more secure alternative to typical passwords because they can’t be stolen, guessed, or leaked. They also provide protection against phishing scams, which occur when a bad actor attempts to trick victims into exposing personal information, often by linking to fake login pages. Since your browser automatically links your passkey with a specific domain, it won’t trigger passkeys on phony webpages. But, as pointed out by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, there’s still a risk if you have your password memorized and type it into the fake webpage anyway. Meta doesn’t provide a specific timeline for when passkey support will arrive, only saying it will launch on Android and iOS “soon.” The company plans on bringing passkey support to the Messenger app as well, where you’ll be able to use the same passkey you set up for Facebook. Both platforms will join several other big names that have adopted the more secure sign-in method, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, and the Meta-owned WhatsApp.  Even if you set up a passkey, you’ll still be able to use your password to sign into your Facebook or Messenger account. You can log in using other methods, too, including a physical security key or two-factor authentication. Aside from logging into your account, Meta will let you use your passkey when autofilling payment information on Meta Pay as well. Passkeys can replace traditional passwords with your device’s own authentication methods. That way, you can sign in to Gmail, PayPal, or iCloud just by activating Face ID on your iPhone, your Android phone’s fingerprint sensor, or with Windows Hello on a PC.  Built on WebAuthn (or Web Authentication) tech, two different keys are generated when you create a passkey: one stored by the website or service where your account is and a private key stored on the device you use to verify your identity. Of course, if passkeys are stored on your device, what happens if it gets broken or lost? Since passkeys work across multiple devices, you may have a backup available. Many services that support passkeys will also reauthenticate to your phone number or email address or to a hardware security key, if you have one. Apple’s and Google’s password vaults already support passkeys, and so do password managers like 1Password and Dashlane. 1Password has also created an online directory listing services that allow users to sign in using a passkey.

					Covering the business and politics of space				 WASHINGTON — Varda Space Industries is preparing to launch its fourth spacecraft, W-4, on a SpaceX rideshare mission scheduled to launch as soon as June 21 from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.  The Los Angeles-based startup manufactures pharmaceuticals in orbit and returns them to Earth using specialized reentry capsules. These capsules also are used by military customers to test technologies in the extreme conditions of hypersonic flight.  With W-4, Varda is debuting its first spacecraft built entirely in-house, Nicholas Cialdella, Varda’s chief technology officer, told SpaceNews. The company is consolidating design and production internally, he said, in an effort to shorten the timeline between missions and increase flexibility to tailor vehicles to customer requirements,  COMING SOON: A new email series explaining the Golden Dome initiative, what it means for the space industry and breaking down the latest developments.

Varda decided that vertical integration is necessary for scaling operations, Cialdella said. The company’s first three missions conducted over the past 18 months used spacecraft buses supplied by Rocket Lab.  “We needed to be able to create a platform for a multitude of customers that can fit in our capsule,” he said. “And we really needed that to be something that we could do in-house and quickly, because our major value proposition is high cadence, really increasing the rate at which things reenter.” Varda’s spacecraft, known as “Winnebago” or W-series, are roughly 300 kg and designed for orbital missions that usually last weeks or months.  The vehicle consists of a satellite bus and a capsule that carries a pharmaceutical processing payload. The satellite bus houses a spacecraft’s essential systems: power, propulsion, communication, and navigation.  Once the mission is complete, the spacecraft deorbits and lands a reentry capsule containing the pharmaceutical product. The capsules are protected with advanced heat shields and re-enter Earth’s atmosphere at speeds exceeding Mach 25, which is more than 25 times the speed of sound — a velocity of approximately 18,000 miles per hour. The capsule deploys parachutes for its final descent to Earth. The W-4 mission will test out the new bus design and also attempt a manufacturing process known as solution-based crystallization. This technique dissolves a compound in a solvent and controls its environment to form crystals. In microgravity, such crystallization can produce structures that are difficult or impossible to replicate on Earth. “Getting back data from the crystals helps researchers understand the space environment and how it affects drug manufacturing,” said Cialdella.  The W-4 capsule is also the first to feature a fully Varda-built heat shield, developed as part of a NASA Tipping Point technology transfer agreement. Through the program, Varda received funding to begin commercial production of C-PICA, short for Conformal Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator — a high-performance thermal protection material originally developed at NASA’s Ames Research Center. C-PICA is designed to shield reentry vehicles from extreme heat by slowly eroding in a controlled manner during atmospheric reentry. It’s made from a mix of resin and carbon-based felt, and was previously used on all three of Varda’s earlier capsules, with material sourced from NASA. On W-4, although Varda produced the full heat shield, two shoulder tiles were made by engineers at Ames using the original process. During reentry, Varda and NASA teams will compare the performance of the NASA-made tiles with the rest of the heat shield to evaluate the new commercial production method. The company’s goal is to eventually launch missions on a monthly cadence, said Cialdella. A key step toward that goal came in May, when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approved a five-year reentry license that allows unlimited landings in Australia. Varda’s W-1 mission completed the first commercial reentry on U.S. soil when it landed in Utah in 2024. The W-2 and W-3 missions landed at the Koonibba Test Range in southern Australia earlier this year, establishing the Australian site as the company’s primary landing location. The FAA license covers reentries at the site through February 2029. The license was granted under Part 450, a regulatory framework introduced by the FAA in 2021 to make commercial space operations more flexible. It replaces mission-specific approvals with a performance-based model that allows for multiple flights under a single authorization. “Under this license, so long as they don’t change that mission profile, they’re good to fly as many of these as they want to fly,” said Kelvin Coleman, FAA associate administrator for commercial space transportation. Coleman told SpaceNews that Varda is the first company to fully leverage the new licensing process. “They were able to get this multi-mission approval by virtue of providing us high quality inputs and bringing in the necessary expertise focused on licensing.” Under Part 450 licenses, FAA still monitors operations and requires that companies adhere to safety and risk thresholds, including individual and collective risk assessments. Inspectors are typically present during launch and reentry operations. With its own satellite platform and a more efficient licensing process, Varda is expanding its production and testing infrastructure in El Segundo, California, to support faster mission turnaround, Cialdella said. The company expects growing demand from pharmaceutical firms and defense agencies, as well as organizations that would otherwise rely on the International Space Station to conduct experiments, he said. With the station set to retire as early as 2030 and uncertainty around commercial replacements, Varda is positioning its autonomous platform as a more accessible alternative for microgravity research.

that can fit in our capsule he said And we really needed that to be something that we could do inhouse and quickly because our major value proposition is high cadence really increasing the rate at which things reenter Vardas spacecraft known as Winnebago or Wseries are roughly 300 kg and designed for orbital missions that usually last weeks or months The vehicle consists of a satellite bus and a capsule that carries a pharmaceutical processing payload The satellite bus houses a spacecrafts essential systems power propulsion communication and navigation Once the mission is complete the spacecraft deorbits and lands a reentry capsule containing the pharmaceutical product The capsules are protected with advanced heat shields and reenter Earths atmosphere at speeds exceeding Mach 25 which is more than 25 times the speed of sound a velocity of approximately 18000 miles per hour The capsule deploys parachutes for its final descent to Earth The W4 mission will test out the new bus design and also attempt a manufacturing process known as solutionbased crystallization This technique dissolves a compound in a solvent and controls its environment to form crystals In microgravity such crystallization can produce structures that are difficult or impossible to replicate on Earth Getting back data from the crystals helps researchers understand the space environment and how it affects drug manufacturing said Cialdella The W4 capsule is also the first to feature a fully Vardabuilt heat shield developed as part of a NASA Tipping Point technology transfer agreement Through the program Varda received funding to begin commercial production of CPICA short for Conformal Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator a highperformance thermal protection material originally developed at NASAs Ames Research Center CPICA is designed to shield reentry vehicles from extreme heat by slowly eroding in a controlled manner during atmospheric reentry Its made from a mix of resin and carbonbased felt and was previously used on all three of Vardas earlier capsules with material sourced from NASA On W4 although Varda produced the full heat shield two shoulder tiles were made by engineers at Ames using the original process During reentry Varda and NASA teams will compare the performance of the NASAmade tiles with the rest of the heat shield to evaluate the new commercial production method The companys goal is to eventually launch missions on a monthly cadence said Cialdella A key step toward that goal came in May when the US Federal Aviation Administration approved a fiveyear reentry license that allows unlimited landings in Australia Vardas W1 mission completed the first commercial reentry on US soil when it landed in Utah in 2024 The W2 and W3 missions landed at the Koonibba Test Range in southern Australia earlier this year establishing the Australian site as the companys primary landing location The FAA license covers reentries at the site through February 2029 The license was granted under Part 450 a regulatory framework introduced by the FAA in 2021 to make commercial space operations more flexible It replaces missionspecific approvals with a performancebased model that allows for multiple flights under a single authorization Under this license so long as they dont change that mission profile theyre good to fly as many of these as they want to fly said Kelvin Coleman FAA associate administrator for commercial space transportation Coleman told SpaceNews that Varda is the first company to fully leverage the new licensing process They were able to get this multimission approval by virtue of providing us high quality inputs and bringing in the necessary expertise focused on licensing Under Part 450 licenses FAA still monitors operations and requires that companies adhere to safety and risk thresholds including individual and collective risk assessments Inspectors are typically present during launch and reentry operations With its own satellite platform and a more efficient licensing process Varda is expanding its production and testing infrastructure in El Segundo California to support faster mission turnaround Cialdella said The company expects growing demand from pharmaceutical firms and defense agencies as well as organizations that would otherwise rely on the International Space Station to conduct experiments he said With the station set to retire as early as 2030 and uncertainty around commercial replacements Varda is positioning its autonomous platform as a more accessible alternative for

The forthcoming remake of Final Fantasy Tactics has been developed ""by sheer force"" as the source code of the original PS1 game no longer exists. The long-requested remake was announced at PlayStation's recent State of Play, titled The Ivalice Chronicles, and in a new interview with Square Enix, remake director Kazutoyo Maehiro discussed development challenges. ""There were a number of major challenges, but all of them stemmed from the fact that the master data and source code from the original game no longer existed,"" he said. The data itself wasn't ""mishandled or poorly managed"", he added, but keeping it ""wasn't a normal thing to do at the time"". What's more, production began on the Japanese version but was then overwritten by the data of other languages. To solve this problem, the remake was developed ""by sheer force"", said Maehiro. The director confirmed that newer content from the 2007 War of the Lions PSP re-release won't be included, to ""pay respect to the original game's experience"". So while The Ivalice Chronicles does utilise the improved English translation from the PSP game, it won't include its additional characters and jobs - namely the likes of Balthier, Luso, and the Onion Knight and Dark Knight jobs. Maehiro described the original Final Fantasy Tactics as ""a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective"", and if the team ""were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title."" This also explains why this remake will include a classic version without modern embellishments, although this will still include some quality of life features like autosave and fixed bugs. ""Among fans of the original game, there will be those who believe that the game doesn't need a lot of embellishment. To be honest, I've felt this way about a number of remastered titles in the past,"" said Maehiro. ""So, there was no doubt in our minds that alongside the enhanced version, which is more in-line with the current era and more accessible to newcomers, we should also include a classic version that is based on the original build of the game."" As for the modern version of the game, having it fully voiced ""was a necessity"", said Maehiro. ""On the other hand, the dialogue in the original game was written to be read by the player, so just having it be read out by a voice actor as-is would have felt quite unnatural,"" he added. ""So, with help from Yasumi Matsuno, who wrote the script for the original game, we tweaked the dialogue to make it better suited for voice."" He also discussed the revised visuals. ""One of the things that was so great about the original game was the sprites for the characters, which were cute, yet meticulously crafted,"" said Maehiro. ""The visuals for the maps were also put together in a very striking way, with textures and models that had a kind of warmth to them. ""So, for Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, our aim was to further improve them without losing any of those qualities."" The game will also feature an overhauled UI to match modern standards, as well as additional character conversations. Said Maehiro: ""In the time since the original game was released, fans have shared a lot of requests in relation to the story. By making this game fully voiced, we have become able to convey the characters' emotions more accurately, and I think that because of this, we have been able to explore them, and their relationships with one another, in greater depth."" He hinted that some of these conversations occur under ""very specific conditions"", so players will need to hunt around to discover them. Final Fantasy Tactics was first released on the PlayStation in 1997 in Japan and North America, but wouldn't reach Europe until the War of the Lions PSP re-release. It has since become a beloved addition to the series, but until this remake it's been stuck on old hardware - this was a key reason for this remake to be developed. Following the announcement of The Ivalice Chronicles, original writer Yasumi Matsuno highlighted the political nature of Final Fantasy Tactics. ""And now, in 2025 - a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society - I offer this story once again,"" he said. ""The will to resist is in your hands."" Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles will be released on 30th September for PS5, PS4, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).

Drafting Magic: The Gathering®—FINAL FANTASY™ at the Pro Tour,Magic's latest set is rich with flashy new cards and intriguing interactions. What can fans expect to see when these cards are in the hands of the game's...,,False,https://magic.gg/news/drafting-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-at-the-pro-tour,magic.gg,"Magic: The Gathering®—FINAL FANTASY™ released on MTG Arena ten days before the first draft of Pro Tour Magic: The Gathering—FINAL FANTASY. The task facing the players who will be competing is daunting; they have to learn the cards, draft archetypes, and interactions quickly. From a big-picture perspective, there are three milestones the players are trying to hit. Some will barely make the first milestone and others (probably those with Limited-focused testing teams) will go further. The first milestone is a basic familiarity with the format in terms of colors and archetypes. Which colors are performing the best? Are there standout archetypes? If so, how many, and which ones? The next milestone is finding a few draft archetypes that they feel comfortable playing. Maybe they will get a handle on two or three different decks, understanding the nuances of which cards are important for that archetype and which aren't. If those colors are open during the draft, they can confidently draft that deck and play it. The last milestone is where every player wants to be ahead of the Pro Tour. That's where they've effectively drafted all of the archetypes numerous times—even the ones they'd prefer to avoid in most cases. This gives them a deeper understanding of the format that allows you to proficiently draft and play whichever archetype their seat presents them, even if it's one that shows up rarely. There's a stretch-goal milestone that almost no one, if anyone, reaches. This is where they've explored all of the niche rares in a set and the build-arounds that don't get played very often. At this point, the player in question is basically an expert at the set and would feel comfortable and confident in any setting where that set is being drafted. From my experience behind the scenes with Pro Tour testing teams, their Limited specialists want to get to the last milestone and maybe knock out a few stretch goals if they can. The Constructed players, or people who don't have much time to draft, are usually good with the second milestone. That first milestone is table stakes for the Pro Tour; if they haven't gotten there yet, it's going to be very, very difficult to make a legit run for the Top 8. That's because Limited is a massive part of making a Pro Tour's Top 8. If you look at the records of the players who make it there, it's rare to find one who didn't have a great record in the Limited rounds. And so, with Magic: The Gathering—FINAL FANTASY being the Limited format of this weekend's Pro Tour, players have been eagerly studying the entirety of the card image gallery. What have their findings been? So far? This set has felt remarkably balanced. It's typical in the early stages of a set's Draft format for things to get a bit out of whack as people gravitate to the more straightforward (and often aggressive) archetypes. This can lead to muddled data as the format self-corrects and things balance out. But so far, it's been pretty flat since day one. The early frontrunners have been White-Blue Artifacts, Blue-Red Big Noncreatures, and Red-White Equipment Aggro. Let's take a big-picture look at the white-blue and blue-red archetypes. This deck is somewhat self-explanatory as it's primarily a two-color deck centered around artifacts and payoffs for playing artifacts. For the most part, this is the only color pair that cares about artifacts, so you'll be able to get the key cards from the deck mostly unimpeded. Mostly, though, this deck relies on the raw card quality from this color pair, particularly the commons. White AuraciteWhite Mage's StaffMagitek InfantryGaelicat White Auracite, White Mage's Staff, Magitek Infantry, and Gaelicat are all key white commons that play into the core theme of the deck. White Auracite is both premium removal and an artifact, so it's the perfect fit for this deck. White Mage's Staff doesn't look amazing at first glance, but it's a great example of a key mechanic that this archetype takes advantage of: the job select keyword. Job select lets you treat Equipment that have it as a creature while still activating artifact synergies. Magitek Infantry has also been impressive. It's a one-drop, which already means it's in a premium position, but it's also an artifact and can turn into an army of Robot Soldiers if you can get it rolling. I would start at three copies of the card before I got excited, and anything above that is just better. Gaelicat is a payoff for all of these artifacts at common. Often the good payoffs are at uncommon or a higher rarity, but this one is pretty decent. And, as mentioned before, this is the only deck interested in artifact payoffs, so you can get them late if you're in white-blue. The blue commons for this deck are interesting as they are mostly just generically good cards rather than artifact-centric picks. Dragoon's WyvernCombat TutorialIce Magic Dragoon's Wyvern is just a straight-up power play and perhaps the best common in the set. Combat Tutorial adds a little something to an already decent card. Given that this deck likes to turn its creatures sideways, that +1/+1 counter goes a long way. Ice Magic is reasonably priced interaction at any of its three tiers. Overall, white-blue decks tend to play like assertive midrange decks, trending toward the aggressive end of the spectrum rather than the controlling side. Curve-outs and proactive plays are the name of the game. Go for the win by taking advantage of the deck's synergies in combination with the raw power of the cards accessible to this deck. This deck is an interesting take on two things we've seen before: noncreature spells and big spells. What are the key cards from this combination of past archetypes? Four of the best commons for this deck are Thunder Magic, Call the Mountain Chocobo, Ice Magic, and Dreams of Laguna. Thunder MagicCall the Mountain ChocoboIce MagicDreams of LagunaSahagin What's one thing all of these non-creature spells have in common? They all can cost four mana if you want them to. Thunder Magic is flexible and powerful, and its {3}{R} mode hits the sweet spot for this deck since it will trigger all of your payoffs while killing most opposing threats. Call the Mountain Chocobo lets you hit your land drops, makes a creature token, and acts as a four-mana spell. This card is a perfect fit since these decks can struggle with finding enough creatures to attack and block while casting noncreature spells. The Mountain it finds also helps you get enough mana for expensive flashback and tiered cards. Ice Magic and Dreams of Laguna are both solid noncreature spells with the upside of being castable for four mana when needed. Sahagin is similar to Gaelicat in that it's a common payoff for the archetype. But there's a key difference: Sahagin is just better. This little guy is annoying and only costs two mana. With three toughness and the ability to grow later in the game for essentially no cost, it has a lot to offer for a common no other deck is interested in. Shantotto, Tactician MagicianUltros, Obnoxious OctopusThe Emperor of Palamecia As for uncommon payoffs, the deck has some nice legendary creatures like Shantotto, Tactician Magician; Ultros, Obnoxious Octopus; and The Emperor of Palamecia. Uncommon payoffs like these are a real draw for an archetype like this since you'll have cornered the market on them. They're niche cards, so nobody else at the table will be interested in taking them. If you're the only one in blue-red, an Ultros, Obnoxious Octopus that gets opened in the third round of Play Boosters will likely make it to you. Lightning Bolt [4xTvv4Ed8uuV49Dbpbzhd0] And yes, I would be remiss if I did not to mention that you have access to one of Magic's all-time greatest spells in this format: Lightning Bolt as ""Thrum of the Vestige."" With two top-performing archetypes mapped out, I have to mention a deck I've been experimenting with to some success. It's unwise to put too much emphasis on week-one success with any archetype, but the Towns deck has been really fun and done quite well in my testing. I found that a black-green-blue base is best for the deck. You get green-blue's Town payoffs alongside black's removal and value cards to shore up any weaknesses. Sometimes I also splash for red, pushing the deck to four colors, or even the full five-color build if I get a great card in white. This is the best kind of a deck: a slow value deck. As such, card draw, removal, and two-for-ones are the name of the game. Sephiroth's InterventionTown GreeterVayne's TreacheryDragoon's WyvernCombat Tutorial Each of these top commons for the deck fit one of the above descriptions. Sephiroth's Intervention is kind of the perfect turn-four play, with the extra life it provides being critical. Vayne's Treachery is flexible against quick aggressive decks and midrange decks alike. Town Greeter, Combat Tutorial, and Dragoon's Wyvern all are pure value plays at common. Even though it's incremental, they really do add up over the course of the game. Travel the Overworld Payoffs like Travel the Overworld are cool, but there's already a lot of card draw available in the format, so this isn't the kind of card that's at the heart of the Towns deck. The deck is really about being able to run any number of rare and mythic rare threats that having good mana allows you to cast. Jenova, Ancient CalamitySin, Spira's PunishmentEmet-Selch, UnsunderedThe Wandering Minstrel These are just a few of the options available here, and the deck's mana lets you dip into red or white as needed. I am curious if this deck is the kind of thing that can perform at the highest level. Only one way to find out! Tune in on Friday, June 20, for the first draft of Pro Tour Magic: The Gathering—FINAL FANTASY. I'll be in the booth with Paul Cheon covering all the action, and I can't wait to see you there! @Marshall_LR

Mountain it finds also helps you get enough mana for expensive flashback and tiered cards Ice Magic and Dreams of Laguna are both solid noncreature spells with the upside of being castable for four mana when needed Sahagin is similar to Gaelicat in that its a common payoff for the archetype But theres a key difference Sahagin is just better This little guy is annoying and only costs two mana With three toughness and the ability to grow later in the game for essentially no cost it has a lot to offer for a common no other deck is interested in Shantotto Tactician MagicianUltros Obnoxious OctopusThe Emperor of Palamecia As for uncommon payoffs the deck has some nice legendary creatures like Shantotto Tactician Magician Ultros Obnoxious Octopus and The Emperor of Palamecia Uncommon payoffs like these are a real draw for an archetype like this since youll have cornered the market on them Theyre niche cards so nobody else at the table will be interested in taking them If youre the only one in bluered an Ultros Obnoxious Octopus that gets opened in the third round of Play Boosters will likely make it to you Lightning Bolt 4xTvv4Ed8uuV49Dbpbzhd0 And yes I would be remiss if I did not to mention that you have access to one of Magics alltime greatest spells in this format Lightning Bolt as Thrum of the Vestige With two topperforming archetypes mapped out I have to mention a deck Ive been experimenting with to some success Its unwise to put too much emphasis on weekone success with any archetype but the Towns deck has been really fun and done quite well in my testing I found that a blackgreenblue base is best for the deck You get greenblues Town payoffs alongside blacks removal and value cards to shore up any weaknesses Sometimes I also splash for red pushing the deck to four colors or even the full fivecolor build if I get a great card in white This is the best kind of a deck a slow value deck As such card draw removal and twoforones are the name of the game Sephiroths InterventionTown GreeterVaynes TreacheryDragoons WyvernCombat Tutorial Each of these top commons for the deck fit one of the above descriptions Sephiroths Intervention is kind of the perfect turnfour play with the extra life it provides being critical Vaynes Treachery is flexible against quick aggressive decks and midrange decks alike Town Greeter Combat Tutorial and Dragoons Wyvern all are pure value plays at common Even though its incremental they really do add up over the course of the game Travel the Overworld Payoffs like Travel the Overworld are cool but theres already a lot of card draw available in the format so this isnt the kind of card thats at the heart of the Towns deck The deck is really about being able to run any number of rare and mythic rare threats that having good mana allows you to cast Jenova Ancient CalamitySin Spiras PunishmentEmetSelch UnsunderedThe Wandering Minstrel These are just a few of the options available here and the decks mana lets you dip into red or white as needed I am curious if this deck is the kind of thing that can perform at the highest level Only one way to find out Tune in on Friday June 20 for the first

					Covering the business and politics of space				 PARIS — Venturi Space, a company that has partnered with Astrolab on lunar rover concepts, unveiled an all-European rover design it hopes to offer to European space agencies. The Monaco-based company unveiled the rover concept, called Mona Luna, at an event during the Paris Air Show June 16. The robotic rover, 2.5 meters long and 1.64 meters wide, weighs 750 kilograms. Mona Luna was designed by Venturi Space as a concept to offer to the European Space Agency and French space agency CNES, along with potential commercial customers, as a larger rover better able to handle the lunar terrain and also survive the lunar night. “On the moon we have a lot of slopes and loose soil, so you need an ATV,” or all-terrain vehicle, said Antonio Delfino, director of space affairs at Venturi Space, in an interview. “Nobody at the moment is doing an ATV.” COMING SOON: A new email series explaining the Golden Dome initiative, what it means for the space industry and breaking down the latest developments.

The rover features suspension and steering systems better able to handle lunar terrain, he said, and is designed to travel at up to 20 kilometers per hour. Those systems and other key components are all housed inside the rover, kept as close to the center as possible for better thermal management during the extreme temperature swings between lunar day and night. The size of the rover is also critical, he added. “In the future, if you want to mine the moon, explore the moon, you need a massive rover,” he said. “When we talk about a massive rover, the technology addressed with it is totally different from the technology for a small rover.” Mona Luna uses battery and “hyper-deformable” wheel technologies that Venturi is also supplying to Astrolab, an American company that is developing lunar rovers, including for NASA’s Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) program. Delfino noted the technologies used on Mona Luna are entirely European and that there is a “wall” in place to separate work on that rover with Astrolab’s projects. Astrolab, though, displayed models of its rovers in the same exhibit space at the show. Venturi has received some support from ESA for key technologies needed for the rover. The company is hoping to win support for a rover development project at ESA’s ministerial conference in late November, when member states will decide on funding for agency programs for the next three years. Delfino argued a rover like Mona Luna fit a gap in Europe’s exploration plans. Mona Lisa is designed to be delivered to the lunar surface on ESA’s Argonaut lander, which would launch on an Ariane 64. “In Europe at the moment there is no program to explore the moon with a rover,” he said. “There is the Argonaut lander and we have the Ariane 64, but a rover is missing, so we are pushing very hard to convince them this is important.” One approach to develop the rover could be a public private partnership, similar to what NASA is pursuing with the LTV program where companies will pay a portion of its costs. He said he mentioned this to Josef Aschbacher, ESA director general, and Daniel Neuenschwander, the agency’s director of human and robotic exploration, and got a positive reception. “It will be easier for them to decide to go forward on this.” He said private companies have shown an interest in the rover as well. “We have some contact with private industry that is interested in Europe,” he said. “And, why not, also outside of Europe.”

Sometimes, that artwork was a rough draft of the design, but other times, Hades 2 relied on a generic, green-hooded character who stood in for the god in question. For most of this stretch, the self-obsessed character of myth, Narcissus, was shown in Hades 2 with this mysterious artwork. But as of Tuesday’s big Unseen update, Narcissus has a real appearance. And…Supergiant is really going for it, huh? The indie studio has historically leaned into the erotic aspects of Greek myth in an effort to best capture the culture that would come up with the concept of, say, a party god. There’s also no way around the fact that many of the stories revolve around sex; Zeus alone has an alarming rap sheet. In the first game, this often meant sultry voice performances for major characters, some of which the player could romance. The actors were given directions that included the words “mischievous” and “suggestive.” The recordings were so intimate, you could trace the rasp of a character’s voice. Then there was the soundtrack. It was as if every pluck of the Turkish lute placed you in the audience of a storyteller so grand, that performance must have helped cement the stories we now know and love. Characterizations of gods were also written in a charged way that made it obvious everyone had a history with one another, and some of that unfinished business might’ve not been entirely platonic. Players could be forgiven for forgetting they weren’t playing a romance game in between combat encounters. Hades 2 doubled down on its carnal tendencies by allowing players to essentially take characters out on dates, including an entire bath house sequence where everyone is dressed down and soaking. Dionysus wears a thong now. That this series would come up with a hot version of Narcissus is expected. That he would look like a twink who is actively getting in position still stands out as a bold choice. Fans are enraptured. The top comment on the YouTube trailer is about Narcissus, and social media is full of fans who are screaming about the reveal. “okay but if i was narcissus and i looked like this? i’d never stop looking at myself either,” one X user says. The Narcissus change stands alongside a few other character revisions, like Prometheus, who is less clean cut and now actively bleeding from the mouth. The next round of fan art that spurts from this will be inspired, I’m sure. I’m psyched to see the direction Supergiant took this in, but part of me enjoyed the enigma of the placeholder art. It was weirdly fitting; here’s this man who is so deeply beautiful, us mere mortals aren’t allowed to rest our gaze on him. We can only imagine what he looks like, and our conceptualization will probably fall short. The only person who can see Narcissus actively dies in the process. But this is good, too.

During an interview with Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance, AEW President Tony Khan was asked if he’s the type of wrestling promoter who will “take a chair to the head.” Khan brought up the one time he was attacked in AEW ring, and indicated it will never happen again. “I really don’t want to get into the ring, and I like to think of myself as the commissioner as more of a device. When you watch NFL football, we have a great commissioner. He’s done so many great things for the league. The way the NFL features Roger [Goodell], I think is fantastic. It’s great to have the commissioner involved in the game. He makes the rulings from on high, but when you watch an NFL football game, it’s not 47 minutes of Roger. And you don’t need to see 47 minutes of me on Dynamite, nor do you ever really see me on the show. As the matchmaker and the promoter, I’m a device on the show. One time I was attacked, and I am very lucky to be sitting here with you right now, Brian. One year ago, I survived the deadliest move in pro wrestling, the spike piledriver...it’s banned in several states. It’s illegal in the state of Tennessee. It’s illegal in Mexico.  ...I don’t want to necessarily get into the ring. My one time, I got tricked and attacked in the ring, is enough to keep me out for life.” I don’t know. Just because Tony says he’s out for life doesn’t mean a scheming heel won’t try to trick him into the ring again for a chair shot to the head.

"Nintendo just banned a ton of Switch 2 consoles, turning them into offline-only bricks",Nintendo is taking serious action against Switch 2 owners who use MiG hacks: The hardware will be banned from connecting to the web.,"{'thumbnail': 'https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTNOVVE1T0RKVGFYWXdSR3RuVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df-rw', 'thumbnailProxied': 'https://img.devisty.store/newsimage/CC8iI0NnNTNOVVE1T0RKVGFYWXdSR3RuVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdB'}",False,https://bgr.com/tech/nintendo-bans-switch-2-consoles-after-mig-hacks-turning-them-into-offline-only-bricks/,Boy Genius Report,"Sign up for our daily newsletter BGR's team sends an AM subscriber-only newsletter with the top tech & entertainment stories at 9AM ET.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the fastest-selling console of all time, and it might be tough to get your hands on one if you didn’t preorder or buy it on release day. What I’m getting at is that it could be hard to replace your Switch 2 if something went wrong and you couldn’t use it anymore. What could happen to it? I’m not talking about the Switch 2 getting punctured by receipts or dealing with Joy-Con 2 drift right out of the box. The real problem is having Nintendo ban your specific console from connecting to the internet after using the MiG Switch/Flash tool on your new device.

 Plenty of users who used the MiG microSD tool discovered that their Switch 2 consoles could no longer connect to the web. A screen displaying error code 2124-4508 appears on the console, informing them that “the use of online services on this console is currently restricted by Nintendo.”










 As shown in the video at the end of this post, there’s not much you can do to recover your console. A Switch 2 that loaded a MiG card remains banned even after a factory reset.

You can still play games offline on a banned Switch 2, but that’s not the experience most people are looking for. Playing Mario Kart with friends is one of the highlights of the Switch 2. You also won’t be able to buy content from Nintendo’s online store or export your game save data. If you reset to factory settings, like YouTuber Scattered Brain did, you’ll lose access to offline games too. In that case, the banned console basically becomes an expensive brick. It’s still unclear whether Nintendo will eventually lift the ban. The error message says the console is “currently” restricted, but it doesn’t give any timeframe.










 You could try reaching out to Nintendo support and asking if there’s any way to undo the ban. Maybe they’ll figure you’ve learned your lesson and will stick to buying games from the eShop. Or they might just tell you to buy a new console. I’m just speculating. YouTuber Scattered Brain says he used the MiG tool to dump the Switch games he bought onto a microSD card. That’s a legit use of the MiG hack that doesn’t involve piracy. It just puts all your cartridges in one place for convenience. But others, maybe someone you know, might use the MiG tool to run pirated games on the Switch. That’s the real reason Nintendo is cracking down on MiG hacks.










 The video below shows the ban only applies to the Switch 2, not earlier models. If you and your friends want to use MiG hacks, you’ll need to stick with the older hardware.

While most can agree that the series has always been adept at high-quality shooting and games packed with things to do, the Borderlands style of humor has become something so divisive that when Borderlands 4’s narrative director explicitly said that the series was moving away from “meme-style humor,” it was cause for celebration.Â  For it’s easy to forget that the series didn’t start off poisoned by internet brain rot. Borderlands, while having some zany humor and an at-times crude tone, was a revolutionary breath of fresh air when it debuted in 2009. The game, which underwent a late-in-life art style change to the instantly recognisable cell-shaded style still used by the franchise, was a smash hit. Popular with fans and critically well-received, the concept of a first-person shooter RPG where you could find billions of different potential weapons was a novel one. Watch our exclusive Borderlands 4 gameplay video… But since then, over 15 years of looter shooters have come and gone, and in Gearbox‘s last outing, Borderlands 3, it felt like some elements of the game hadn’t moved on enough from that first journey in Pandora. Borderlands 4 looks to change that. “When we were working on Borderlands 3, one of our big goals was to improve the gunplay,” said Chris Brock, the executive producer of Borderlands 4. Brock, a Gearbox veteran who has worked on the series for its duration, tells us that with Borderlands 4, Gearbox focused on exploration. “We thought that we did a good job. And then going from Borderlands 3 to Borderlands 4, we said, okay, if we could do the same thing for exploration that we just did for guns, we’re really on to something. That’s a big improvement. And so we came in it from that angle first, and then I was like, okay, we’ll now build a world that takes advantage of all those things.” During our two-hour period playing Borderlands 4, this focus on exploration is clear. The world is much larger, and no longer separated into small zones gated off by loading screens. There are more spontaneous fights, and in-world events as you travel from mission to mission, and there are far more points of interest. We didn’t think Borderlands had much to improve in the shooting department, so this change in direction to a more open, explorable world, rather than a background you run past as you’re going from mission to mission, is a big improvement. Those more curated experiences are still in the game, like dungeons or the interiors of buildings, but there’s a much greater incentive to explore the world now. The game is a narrative continuation from Borderlands 3, though Gearbox is keen to emphasise that there’s no need for players to be intimately familiar with legacy characters or old games. “There are more spontaneous fights, and in-world events as you travel from mission to mission, and there are far more points of interest.” Taylor Clark, Borderlands 4’s lead writer, tells us, “Narratively, itâs both a fresh start and a continuation. Itâs a new planet that is very different from Pandora, with a very different kind of villain than weâve had before. So naturally, it will feel fresh and new and exciting, but Borderlands 3 ended with Lilith warping away Elpis, so weâre chasing that narrative thread. “You donât need to have played all the old games to understand it, but you have something that rewards people who are coming from Borderlands 3 and also people who want to jump in, with no experience.” The elephant in the room is the question of what style of comedy Borderlands 4 will use. Clark begins to laugh when we bring up the controversial meme-style humor, and the visceral reaction it evokes from a section of the audience. “Of course, we were aware of the feedback that Borderlands 3 got, and we took all the valid criticism on board. Weâre creating an entirely new world, and we want to have a tone that fits the new planet weâre on. Pandora was like the Wild West, this new planet is a totalitarian world, so having everybody making jokes every minute wouldnât feel totally right.â In both humor and mission design, Gearbox is keen to keep things fresh. However, for a franchise that has had at least six games in the last 15 years, it can be challenging to come up with new ideas. Taylor Clark says the team is in its “Simpsons Era,” referring to the idea that when the team comes up with a new take on something in Borderlands 4, there’s a decent chance Gearbox has done it before. “Weâre in the writers’ room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, ‘We did that in Borderlands’,” he says. “Weâre always trying not to repeat ourselves; thatâs why our villains are so different. Weâre always trying to keep it fresh.” “Weâre in the writers’ room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, ‘We did that in Borderlands'” Chris Brock tells us that developing a new Borderlands game is always a balancing act. “How much of it should be all new? How much should be the same since thatâs why people like your game?” When Borderlands debuted, the looter shooter genre didn’t exist. While loot games are decades old, Borderlands preceded the more than a decade of every major company throwing its hat into the looter shooter ring, with mixed results. While some franchises endured like the oft-troubled Destiny, far more failed to gain traction with a fanbase that’s quick to move on from game to game. “We play all of them, and we understand what other people are doing,” says Brock. “We might see something that we thought was cool, but we always want to ‘Borderlandsify’ it.” One thing they won’t adapt from other games in the genre is character creation. “We think we make great characters, and we want these characters to have character. Itâs a cool thing to do, but it’s not one of our values, but itâs not what we do,” he adds. So far, Borderlands 4 is a lot of fun to play, but so were all of the other games in the series. It feels like this latest entry needs to be more than that. While we didn’t get a great sense of the characters or how they’ll fare across a 30+ hour campaign, the grating humor has certainly been toned down. Borderlands 4 feels like a sequel to Borderlands 2, rather than going further in the direction of 3, and that’s an exciting prospect for us. However, for players new to the series, it feels like it could serve just as well as a reboot. Sure, you’ll miss a reference here, and you might not know why the bobbleheads scattered around the game depict an old Russian man, but do you need to? “I donât think it was a conscious decision to make this game a jumping-in point for players,” says Brock. “I just have faith. Iâve been doing this a long time now, and I have faith that if we make a cool game, that we think is fun, we think provides value, then the new players will be there. “We also have a lot of staunch, long-time fans. Iâve had so many people say that they remember buying the first game in 2009, and now itâs something that theyâre playing with their kids, itâs crazy.” What has remained consistent from 2009 is that Gearbox’s gunplay is excellent. After Borderlands 3, virtually everything else is up for discussion, especially for fans who’ve left the series. Still, from what we’ve seen so far, Borderlands 4 seems to know exactly what turned people away and is an excellent argument for getting them back. We sometimes publish affiliate links on VGC.

 To say that Microsoft's Xbox efforts have been controversial would be an understatement. Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S console platform has been thoroughly outsold by the PlayStation 5 this gen, as Microsoft's Xbox One misfire surrendered an entire generation of gamers to digital PlayStation lock-in. Questions about Microsoft's ability to deliver quality first-party games in a consistent cadence, its commitment to the future of Xbox hardware, and a strategy that sees iconic exclusives like Forza and Gears of War head to rival platforms has frustrated and confused customers over the past decade. But, the turbulent times seem to be over. After a mountain of acquisitions, Microsoft is now delivering quality and variety more consistently than any other publisher on the market. Those games are all guaranteed day one in Xbox Game Pass too, and come with a dual Xbox and PC license and cloud saves via Xbox Play Anywhere. The Xbox Series X remains a powerhouse, while the affordable Xbox Series S is the cheapest way to get the latest games. Xbox Game Pass is having its best sprint of quality additions ever. And finally, Microsoft confirmed that it is committed to future Xbox hardware, revealing a renewed long-term partnership with AMD for next-gen console hardware. Has Xbox finally turned a corner?  Gaming isn't a simple utilitarian thing, and sometimes I've wondered if Microsoft forgets that at times when shaping Xbox's direction and messaging. Gaming is more than simply buying and using a product — its a hobby, and a community. A very passionate community, where sentiment plays a much larger role than it does for things like Microsoft 365 for Business or Windows Azure. As Microsoft pulled the trigger on putting games onto PlayStation full in the knowledge that Xbox customers will get nothing in return from Sony, many Xbox fans felt betrayed. The idea that spreadsheets were running the show sucked a lot of the joy out of the room, and excitement for the platform in general. Xbox itself said that Sony uses money from Xbox games like Minecraft to exclude Xbox customers from third-party titles like Black Myth Wukong, Silent Hill 2, and Final Fantasy 16 — which end up hitting Xbox months or sometimes years after the fact. It's hard not to feel like a second class citizen in that gaming universe. When the frame of reference for the industry falls on things like Sega's infamous post-Dreamcast exit, and failed Microsoft consumer commitments like Windows Phone — it's not hard to understand why many thought Xbox was gearing up to become just another simple, boring publisher. Over the past few months, Xbox has worked hard to convince us that this won't be the case. Lads... Between the line-up this year, and next year, Xbox Game Pass drops, Xbox Games Showcase, promising hardware plans plus backward compatibility ... I slowly start to feel that energy again 🥹June 17, 2025 Xbox Game Pass has been on an absolute tear the past few months, landing banger after banger with titles like Blue Prince, Clair Obscur, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and various others. The near-term future looks absurdly stacked too, with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2, Keeper, and more slated for later this year. The Xbox Showcase earlier in the month gave us a glimpse at a truly glorious future for Microsoft's first-party, with studios like InXile and Obsidian hitting new levels of production quality. There's so many other projects on the horizon too, like State of Decay 3, Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, and support from third-party publishers is stronger than ever too. Square Enix and other Japanese publishers have been lining up to join the Xbox party, and seem more eager than ever to share a stage with team green. I think the real turning point was the recent flurry of hardware commitments, above all. It's easy to look back through the games industry at other companies that exited hardware and draw comparisons. It's true that Microsoft's Xbox hardware sales figures haven't made for optimistic reading over the past few quarters. But it's really a small piece of the wider ecosystem Microsoft is building here. We got a full commitment to next-gen Xbox hardware this week, complete with assurances that it will run your current library of Xbox games via backward compatibility. That has reinvigorated confidence in the platform among those who seek to doubt Microsoft's commitment. Microsoft also hinted that its partnership with AMD could yield Xbox devices ""in the living room, and in your hands,"" implying that the holy grail of a native handheld Xbox console gaming experience is still on the cards. The announcements helped put to bed rumors that future Xbox hardware would be made entirely by third-parties, which emerged after Microsoft unveiled the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld with ASUS. That doesn't mean Microsoft isn't gunning to bring Xbox and Windows 11 closer than ever. The hints that the next-gen Xbox could also incorporate Steam and other PC stores opens up a universe of possibilities and versatility that has typically excluded console gamers, and even PC gamers when it comes to playing conveniently from the living room, desk and keyboard-free. I've seen positive reactions from mainstream content creators who usually wouldn't give Xbox even a polite second glance. Across Xbox Cloud Gaming, third-party Xbox-branded PC gaming hardware, first-party Xbox console hardware with backwards compatibility, and Windows 11 itself — Microsoft's vision of a digital gaming ecosystem where your content, save files, and community goes with you is well and truly taking shape. The road will be long and challenging to navigate, but for the first time in a long time, in my opinion, it feels like the destination is visible on the horizon.

It’s launching a new hub for games like Bracket City. Daily puzzle games are seemingly everywhere right now, and starting today, you’ll be able to add a new stop to your puzzle rotation: The Atlantic. The publication is launching a new hub for its growing game offerings, including already available games like Bracket City and Caleb’s Inferno Crossword Puzzle, as well as some new puzzles. You’ll be able to access the hub on both the web and in The Atlantic’s app. Caleb Madison, The Atlantic’s director of games, gave The Verge a demo of most of the games available in the hub ahead of today’s launch: Madison doesn’t necessarily see The Atlantic’s games as replacing your visits to other daily puzzles. “I think people have a pretty ravenous diet for new games, so I don’t think coming to The Atlantic precludes any of these other amazing games that are at The New York Times or Apple News or LinkedIn,” Madison says. “What I feel like The Atlantic has to offer that’s different from those publications is a little bit more of a bespoken, artisanal aesthetic.” Madison also tries to bring an “aesthetic narrative component” to games to help them feel “immersive and special.” Bracket City, for example, has some city-themed elements sprinkled throughout, like the “fan mail” email being mayor@bracket.city. Like with The New York Times, some aspects of The Atlantic’s games will only be available if you’re a paid subscriber. Bracket City and all of its archives are free. The full archives for Stacks, Fluxis, and The Atlantic’s daily mini crossword will be behind a paywall, however; nonsubscribers will only have access to the three most recent puzzles for those games. All of the Caleb’s Inferno crossword puzzles are exclusive to subscribers. Madison says he has “a lot of plans” for more games, including long-form games of some kind. “I’m trying to make no assumptions as to what that would look like and just forge forward creatively to see what a more layered day-to-day experience would be like.” He didn’t want to give anything specific away, but he says, “I am excited to innovate in the game space and bring unique and authentic, long-form game experiences to The Atlantic users and to people online.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Things like “always hit the small camp first to get level 2"" and “never fight the Bell Bearing Hunter boss beneath the castle.” A third is “don’t bother trying to revive someone with three bars unless you have your ult.” But time and time again, players try to do that anyway. Now we finally have the math to prove why that’s such a dumb idea.  YouTuber Zullie the Witch, always at the forefront of FromSoftology, laid out how resurrecting fallen allies actually works in Nightreign in a recent video (via PC Gamer). While the visual icon over a fallen party member’s body shows a trisected circle with one segment filled for each time they’ve been downed, it turns out the actual number of hits it takes to bring them back to their feet scales dramatically with each full bar. (Yes, you revive your teammates by doing damage to them.) Anyone who’s spent a few hours with the multiplayer roguelike intrinsically knows this, but having the math clearly laid out should help discourage anyone from trying to be a hero and getting cooked by a Nightlord in the process: As Zullie the Witch explains, attacks done in an effort to revive a teammate are logged completely differently than normal damage against enemies. Each weapon type does a certain base amount of damage—starting at 10 for daggers and torches and peaking at 25 for ballistas—and it takes 40 damage points to fill up the first revive bar. Simple enough, a flurry of quick stabs with a dagger will do it. But the second and third bars are where things get deceivingly devilish. At two bars, the damage required per bar is 45 for a total of 90, and at three bars its 80 each, for a whopping total of 240 damage.  That would be tough enough on its own, but the extra tricky part comes from how fast the bars refill in-between hits. At one bar, the meter refills at just two damage per second. At two bars, meanwhile, the refill happens at nine damage per second, while at three bars, they’re refilling at 40 points per second. That’s why it’s essentially impossible to revive other teammates without an ultimate cooldown ready when you’re the last one standing. Turning your attention away for even a second to dodge an incoming attack will see almost all of your progress lost.  So why do many players insist on trying to revive thrice-downed teammates anyway? Psychologically, the fact that our minds are trained by the UI to think linearly while the game is scaling exponentially is no doubt part of it. Another is that no one wants to be the reason their team failed, getting your ass beat while strangers watch powerless to help. Third, it’s kind of just terrifying to go up against Nightreign’s tougher bosses with no backup.  Unless you’re used to playing solo, the game has a knack for making you think you’re better than you are because of how easy it is to whale on enemies while they’re trading off aggro against two other players. Once the odds are evened, the truth has nowhere to hide. As Zullie the Witch has shown, though, your best bet is to just dig in, block, dodge, and take pot shots until your ultimate art is ready.  .",Elden Ring Nightreign Is Lying To You About How Long It Takes To Revive Someone And Its Not Even CloseThere are some fundamental rules to surviving in Elden Ring Nightreign Things like always hit the small camp first to get level 2 and never fight theThere are some fundamental rules to surviving in Elden Ring Nightreign Things like always hit the small camp first to get level 2 and never fight the Bell Bearing Hunter boss beneath the castle A third is dont bother trying to revive someone with three bars unless you have your ult But time and time again players try to do that anyway Now we finally have the math to prove why thats such a dumb idea YouTuber Zullie the Witch always at the forefront of FromSoftology laid out how resurrecting fallen allies actually works in Nightreign in a recent video via PC Gamer While the visual icon over a fallen party members body shows a trisected circle with one segment filled for each time theyve been downed it turns out the actual number of hits it takes to bring them back to their feet scales dramatically with each full bar Yes you revive your teammates by doing damage to them Anyone whos spent a few hours with the multiplayer roguelike intrinsically knows this but having the math clearly laid out should help discourage anyone from trying to be a hero and getting cooked by a Nightlord in the process As Zullie the Witch explains attacks done in an effort to revive a teammate are logged completely differently than normal damage against enemies Each weapon type does a certain base amount of damagestarting at 10 for daggers and torches and peaking at 25 for ballistasand it takes 40 damage points to fill up the first revive bar Simple enough a flurry of quick stabs with a dagger will do it But the second and third bars are where things get deceivingly devilish At two bars the damage required per bar is 45 for a total of 90 and at three bars its 80 each for a whopping total of 240 damage That would be tough enough on its own but the extra tricky part comes from how fast the bars refill inbetween hits At one bar the meter refills at just two damage per second At two bars meanwhile the refill happens at nine damage per second while at three bars theyre refilling at 40 points per second Thats why its essentially impossible to revive other teammates without an ultimate cooldown ready when youre the last one standing Turning your attention away for even a second to dodge an incoming attack will see almost all of your progress lost So why do many players insist on trying to revive thricedowned teammates anyway Psychologically the fact that our minds are trained by the UI to think linearly while the game is scaling exponentially is no doubt part of it Another is that no one wants to be the reason their team failed getting your ass beat while strangers watch powerless to help Third its kind of just terrifying to go up against Nightreigns tougher bosses with no backup Unless youre used to playing solo the game has a knack for making you think youre better than you are because of how easy it is to whale on enemies while theyre trading off aggro against two other players Once the odds are evened the truth has nowhere to hide As Zullie the Witch has shown though your best bet is to just dig in block dodge and take pot shots until your ultimate art is ready

This paid expansion, which picks up a decade after the events of the main game, sees diver Mhairi swim to the depths of the ocean to uncover the truth of the Beira D oil rig. It’s a great premise, and one filled once more with the authentic Scottish accents we loved so much in the base game. Sadly, a lot of what made Still Wakes The Deep special is missing here. Where that game crafted a meticulous setting in its oil rig with time-authentic details and melded it with The Thing inspired body horror, Siren’s Rest by comparison feels characterless. A lot of that is down to the setting: the rusted remains of the Beira D. You’ll spend almost the entire game swimming through indistinguishable corridors, and working out simplistic gameplay obstacles, which are a pain due to the clunky controls. The base game was never mechanically deep, but it always had that cinematic appeal. Siren’s Rest does not, and what makes it worse is that, at least pre-launch, the game is riddled with glitches and bugs. On numerous occasions, the character would put on a helmet that was invisible, voice lines would double up and play over each other, and the life-saving air-tether that the DLC tries to ramp up the tension with, kept either clipping through walls, catching on the main character’s arms and obstructing our view, or even just completely disappearing. It’s a shame too because we loved the story the DLC was teeing up, and the pacing was brilliant as it steadily teased the spookier stuff — even if it sort of fell flat for us come the credits. We’re sure that if you’re a fan of the base game, you’ll likely get some enjoyment here, as there are some genuine moments of tension, and we loved getting to hear wee tidbits about the Beira D disaster. However, what it does more than anything else is make us want to go back and play the base game.  Average 5/10 Review copy provided by Secret ModeHow we review productsScoring Policy About Aaron Bayne  Swearing an oath of loyalty to PlayStation with the arrival of the PS4, our resident video-maker and Irn-Bru loving Scot prides himself as an expert in modern-day Sony. However, eight playthroughs of The Last Of Us later, and no Platinum to show for it, will forever be his greatest shame. Comments 26  The first was excellent. Word Up Son!  That's pretty disappointing. I will look for another couple of reviews to see if they feel the same before committing. @AaronBayne how was the story, writing and voice acting? This was absolutely top tier in the base game.  Still wakes the Deep is so underrated it's actually criminal (may even be one of the best walking sims ever), The voice acting alone is god tier which was proven correct as they won awards for it. It's a shame this DLC seems to have lost the magic.  Damn, that's not good... Also hilarious that this is the first I'm hearing of a Still Wakes The Deep DLC 😅  @Jammer The first was excellent, I agree.  @Jammer hey...youre not the word up son guy...whats going on here.  Loved the main game and yes the best parts were exploring the period authentic world. Particularly the intro stages before it kicked off, exploring your cabin or listening to the shipping forecast! 10/10 and my GOTY of '24. So yes I can see why this DLC removes the key selling point. Another favourite game of mine was Soma and that did take place in a crumbling under water facility, but it told a far more profound and disturbing story, as it explored consciousness itself. If it's cheap on PC or included with Gamepass (how I played the original) I might give it a go though.  I really need to play the base game, it’s got actual proper Scottish actors in it and it’s good to support local talent.  Gonna give the main game a go at some point due to its authentic non stereotypical scottish acting (for a change, no groundsman willie here) 😃  PlayStation Access is streaming this in a few hours I believe. Anyone wanting more info might find it useful.  I will still play this since the original is like top 5 games of last year for me. I need to do the plat on that one  @Jammer It's when it feels just like they're doing it because... well... it kinda detracts on the positive things they did first time around. Four words. Star Wars Holiday Special...and I don't think this DLC is that egregious, but you can also tell when something is being done without heart (but then again, to be fair, some people just like the comfort of a repeat performance). There's plenty of pretty poor DLC out there.. if we're being fair. Edit. I think the first game had many, many fans for how authentic it felt. Which makes this feel even more disappointing.  I’m still interested. There’s only 4 reviews so far on OpenCritic and this is by far the lowest (the others are a 7.5, 8 and 8.5). Loved the original and, especially from the other reviews, sounds like I’ll love this too!  @LordAinsley that’s what I was thinking! 😂  @nessisonett ...i finished it at the weekend, it is fantastic  I'll definitely give this a shot at some point. The base game was just sooooo good and for $13, even if the DLC isn't as good as the base game it's a small price to pay. Besides, by the time I actually get around to playing this, **hopefully** the bugs and glitches will have been patched out and maybe I can even catch it at a bit of a discount.  @Oram77 @Oram77 best walking sims ever is that a good or bad thing? I've heard it's good  @Dan12836666 It all depends if you like that genre, other examples are Scorn or Amnesia, everybody has gone to Rapture, but yes is very engaging even with the gameplay on the lite side.  @Oram77 ye ill have Try it then I enjoyed them games especially everybody has gone to rapture funny thing is when I 1st heard about that game I presumed is had something to do with bioshock  @KingPev Just find it cool that Karen Dunbar’s done a game, Chewin The Fat’s a Hogmanay staple.  @Jammer hope you’re enjoying saved by the bell Sanford and son and other stone cold classics !!!  This is disappointing to read, however, I loved the game so much I'm still going to try it. Even if I end up not liking it, supporting studios like this is worth it.  I dont go by one persons opinion especially just push squares because frankly i find their reviews can be pretty hit and miss at times I will do this revolutionary thing and play it and make my own mind up rather than relying on one persons opinion on the internet  @themightyant I liked hearing wee tidbits about the Beira D disaster, and there are some nice narrative moments in there. The voice acting is a bit more subdued here I'd say, but still great for the few characters that feature. However, I think it's lacking that charm even there. I thought Caz was a pretty relatable protagonist by comparison, and Mhairi's narrative stuff just didn't hit the same for me.  @AaronBayne Appreciated. That's a shame!  Surprised to see the mixed reviews on this, loved the base game and figured the DLC was an auto win. I’ll probably still buy it as it’s so cheap, but I’ll be going in with relatively modest expectations to avoid disappointment.

 Warner Bros. Games has announced it has restructured into divisions centered on its four biggest brands: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC. Per Variety, three current studio heads have been promoted to assume leadership roles for the development, production, and tech operations of these divisions. Warner Bros Games Montreal studio head Yves Lachance has been promoted to senior vice president, development. He will oversee the teams working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games.  Shaun Himmerick, studio head of Netherrealm Studios, has been promoted to senior vice president of development. He will be in charge of Mortal Kombat and DC titles. Lastly, Warner Bros. Games  New York Studio chief Steven Flenory is promoted to senior vice president of central tech and services. He will oversee all game and publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance, and user research. Variety states it has confirmed with Warner Bros. that there were no layoffs or executive departures as a result of the restructuring. Earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it would be split into two publicly traded companies to combat declining business: WBD Global Networks and WBD Streaming & Studios. The games division now sits under the latter umbrella, which is led by CEO David Zaslav.   This restructuring comes on the heels of what’s been a tumultuous year for Warner Bros. Games. Despite the massive success of titles like 2023’s Hogwarts Legacy, it has since endured the significant commercial failures of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and, to a lesser extent, MultiVersus and Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions. Mortal Kombat 1, despite selling over 5 million copies since its launch last September, was also considered an underwhelming sales performer compared to previous entries. All four games launched in 2024.  Warner Bros. Q1 2025 financial report stated revenue in the games division decreased 48 percent, naming Suicide Squad's failure as one of the primary factors. Former Warner Bros. Games chief David Haddad stepped down from the company in January. A month later, in February, the publisher shut down three of its games studios: MultiVersus developer Player First Games (after acquiring it less than a year prior), Middle-earth/F.E.A.R. developer Monolith Productions (resulting in the cancelation of its in-development Wonder Woman game), and support studio Warner Bros. Games San Diego. As for what's next in the pipeline, Warner Bros. Games recently launched Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition and announced a mobile RPG called DC World Collide. A Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy arrived on June 5. Beyond this, its future slate of titles is unclear.  [Source: Variety]

 When you think of pirate caves in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you wouldn’t initially think of puzzles involving glowing music notes. At least, that’s not what I initially imagined, but here we are. While you’ll find one within this cave, the rest require some exploring. You’ll find the first Glowing Musical Note inside Skull Rock. After talking to The Forgotten and discovering the “The Music’s on the Walls” quest for the first time, you’ll turn around and spot this note floating in the air. Run after it and collect it to progress through the mission, revealing that you have four more of these to locate. The second music note is inside Ursula’s Cave on Dazzle Beach. You can access this by heading to the northeastern edge of the biome next to the ramp leading into the Forest of Valor. Inside this cave is a hidden treasure spot, along with a glowing musical note in the water. This note is particularly difficult to obtain, as the fishing spot requires precise targeting to land. Aim for the front edge closest to your character for the best shot at succeeding. Our next stop is the Forgotten Lands. In the Forgotten Lands is a night-thorn-covered treehouse that, upon entering, will reveal our fourth note. Chase after it before heading to your fifth and final destination. Our next stop is the Forgotten Lands. In the Forgotten Lands is a night thorn-covered treehouse that, upon entering, will reveal our fourth note.

Make sure to pack some extra food to restore your run energy. Once you have all five Glowing Musical Notes, return to Skull Rock and talk to The Forgotten to begin a new puzzle. Your goal is to use the six barrels and your newly created sheet music to play the complete score, letting you progress through the Music’s on the Walls quest and get one step closer to unlocking Peter Pan.",All Glowing Musical Note locations in Disney Dreamlight ValleyWhen you think of pirate caves in Disney Dreamlight Valley you wouldnt initially think of puzzles involving glowing music notes At least thats not whatPublished Jun 18 2025 1229 pm When you think of pirate caves in Disney Dreamlight Valley you wouldnt initially think of puzzles involving glowing music notes At least thats not what I initially imagined but here we are While youll find one within this cave the rest require some exploring Youll find the first Glowing Musical Note inside Skull Rock After talking to The Forgotten and discovering the The Musics on the Walls quest for the first time youll turn around and spot this note floating in the air Run after it and collect it to progress through the mission revealing that you have four more of these to locate The second music note is inside Ursulas Cave on Dazzle Beach You can access this by heading to the northeastern edge of the biome next to the ramp leading into the Forest of Valor Inside this cave is a hidden treasure spot along with a glowing musical note in the water This note is particularly difficult to obtain as the fishing spot requires precise targeting to land Aim for the front edge closest to your character for the best shot at succeeding Our next stop is the Forgotten Lands In the Forgotten Lands is a nightthorncovered treehouse that upon entering will reveal our fourth note Chase after it before heading to your fifth and final destination Our next stop is the Forgotten Lands In the Forgotten Lands is a night thorncovered treehouse that upon entering will reveal our fourth note Chase after it before heading to your fifth and final destination The final Glowing Musical Note is inside Dream Castle Right when you enter it youll spot the note in the foyer to chase after Make sure to pack some extra food to restore your run energy Once you have all five Glowing Musical Notes return to Skull Rock and talk to The Forgotten to begin a new puzzle Your goal is to use the six barrels and your newly created sheet music to play the complete score letting you progress through the Musics on the Walls quest and get one step closer to unlocking Peter Pan

With iOS 26, CarPlay is getting a few neat enhancements, which includes improved design, an option for bigger font sizes, and useful accessibility features too. Here's everything new coming to CarPlay with Apple's upcoming update: With iOS 26, Live Activities come to CarPlay. These pop-ups allow you to keep a tab on important updates without fiddling with your phone or the head unit. Live Activities on your iPhone is useful to track deliveries, flight statuses, and much more, and while not all iOS use cases will be relevant here, some of these will also be available in CarPlay. (I think the flight status feature will be especially useful for airport pickups and drop-offs.)  You don't need to do anything to see Live Activities in CarPlay. As long as it's visible on your iPhone, it'll show up on the CarPlay dashboard, or appear as a popover on top of other apps such as your navigation app. Apple says you'll be able to disable Live Activities if you don't want to see them, and even control their appearance by setting different Focus modes. CarPlay is also adding support for widgets, including things like calendar entries, weather, and sunrise/sunset times. You'll be able to select which widgets you see on the CarPlay dashboard by going to Settings > General > CarPlay on iPhone, selecting your vehicle, and choosing the widgets. The redesigned CarPlay with iOS 26 now includes a compact view. For example, when you receive a phone call, it will show up as a small pop-up on the screen, instead of taking up more space. This means that other important information, such as driving directions, aren't hidden when you receive a phone call. With iOS 26, the Messages app in CarPlay will allow you to use Tapbacks—Apple parlance for reacting to text messages with emojis. This will let you quickly tap an emoji to respond to someone via the car's display. Messages will also let you view your iPhone's pinned conversations, which makes it easier to text people you're frequently in touch with. Yes, Liquid Glass is coming to your car as well. The icons from iOS 26 have made their way to CarPlay. Whether you love them or hate them, you'll see this new design on your car's display. CarPlay with iOS 26 will also support Large Text, which increases font sizes and makes text easier to read on your car's screen. Apple is also adding Sound Recognition to CarPlay, which will notify drivers and passengers when iOS detects certain sounds. The notifications can warn you when CarPlay detects sirens, a crying baby, horns, or other important sounds. Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

It certainly seems like there’s some validity to the rumor that Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting a 2025 re-release. This week, two of the game’s most prominent voice actors teased that something related to the open-world western is getting announced soon. It’s now on patient fans to play the waiting game. Rob Wiethoff, the voice actor behind Red Dead Redemption protagonist and sequel side character John Marston, could barely contain his excitement on Twitch when talking about an upcoming announcement coming presumably from Rockstar Games.  “I’ve got such exciting news, I can’t share it with you right now,” he told his viewers, adding that whatever is in store would be revealed by the end of the week. “It’s absolutely killing me.” Wiethoff said he wouldn’t be the only one sharing this news when the time comes, and it looks like one of his sequel co-stars spilled the beans that he’s in on it, whatever’s in store. Roger Clarke, the man behind the raspy southerner and Red Dead 2 Protagonist Arthur Morgan, gave a simple but telling response to a fan who asked if he knew what Wiethoff was talking about. “Yes,” he responded with an adorable gif of a dog smiling with approval. While either man was willing to outright say what’s to come (likely under the watchful eye of the notoriously secretive developer), we have to consider that it was rumored just last month that one of the most widely requested updates in all of gaming was finally on the way. Both GameReactor and Nintenduo reported that “sources close to Rockstar” confirmed a Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 would debut on the console sometime this year. That port to Nintendo’s handheld would be announced alongside a current-gen patch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, finally letting the seven-year-old game take advantage of modern hardware. As exciting as this all is for those who missed the game the first time around, I’m holding my breath about this announcement. A Switch 2 port makes sense considering how popular the new handheld is barely two weeks after launch and Take Two’s newfound love for Nintendo. But the current-gen patch is something I’ll need to see for myself. While I’d happily take an update that doubles the framerate, I can’t imagine Red Dead Redemption 2 looking any better than it already does.  Not sure what a next-gen patch for Red Dead Redemption 2 would even look like when it still looks stunning some seven years after release. If this is a simple frame-rate patch similar to the updates Ubisoft has rolled out for older Assassin’s Creed titles, then that’s a tad less exciting than a proper new-gen makeover like Grand Theft Auto 5 gets every few years. Either way, dropping on brand new consoles will likely net the eighth best-selling game of all time another multi-million dollar debut. It comes as a bit of a surprise that this older game in Rockstar’s library is getting a look-in in 2025. Back in 2023, the developer announced that it was ending support for the game’s online mode, disappointing fans who thought it would have the same life as GTA 5. We also know that Rockstar Games has been deep in the development of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is poised to be one of the biggest games ever made. The second trailer for the highly anticipated game reached over 475 million views across internet platforms in 24 hours.",Looks Like Red Dead Redemption 2 Is Getting That Big Update After AllIt certainly seems like theres some validity to the rumor that Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting a 2025 rerelease This week two of the games mostGenerational leap It certainly seems like theres some validity to the rumor that Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting a 2025 rerelease This week two of the games most prominent voice actors teased that something related to the openworld western is getting announced soon Its now on patient fans to play the waiting game Rob Wiethoff the voice actor behind Red Dead Redemption protagonist and sequel side character John Marston could barely contain his excitement on Twitch when talking about an upcoming announcement coming presumably from Rockstar Games Ive got such exciting news I cant share it with you right now he told his viewers adding that whatever is in store would be revealed by the end of the week Its absolutely killing me Wiethoff said he wouldnt be the only one sharing this news when the time comes and it looks like one of his sequel costars spilled the beans that hes in on it whatevers in store Roger Clarke the man behind the raspy southerner and Red Dead 2 Protagonist Arthur Morgan gave a simple but telling response to a fan who asked if he knew what Wiethoff was talking about Yes he responded with an adorable gif of a dog smiling with approval While either man was willing to outright say whats to come likely under the watchful eye of the notoriously secretive developer we have to consider that it was rumored just last month that one of the most widely requested updates in all of gaming was finally on the way Both GameReactor and Nintenduo reported that sources close to Rockstar confirmed a Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 would debut on the console sometime this year That port to Nintendos handheld would be announced alongside a currentgen patch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles finally letting the sevenyearold game take advantage of modern hardware As exciting as this all is for those who missed the game the first time around Im holding my breath about this announcement A Switch 2 port makes sense considering how popular the new handheld is barely two weeks after launch and Take Twos newfound love for Nintendo But the currentgen patch is something Ill need to see for myself While Id happily take an update that doubles the framerate I cant imagine Red Dead Redemption 2 looking any better than it already does Not sure what a nextgen patch for Red Dead Redemption 2 would even look like when it still looks stunning some seven years after release If this is a simple framerate patch similar to the updates Ubisoft has rolled out for older Assassins Creed titles then thats a tad less exciting than a proper newgen makeover like Grand Theft Auto 5 gets every few years Either way dropping on brand new consoles will likely net the eighth bestselling game of all time another multimillion dollar debut It comes as a bit of a surprise that this older game in Rockstars library is getting a lookin in 2025 Back in 2023 the developer announced that it was ending support for the games online mode disappointing fans who thought it would have the same life as GTA 5 We also know that Rockstar Games has been deep in the development of Grand Theft Auto 6 which is poised to be one of the biggest games ever made The second trailer for the highly anticipated game reached over 475 million views across internet platforms in 24 hours

 Well, in a twist that'd be strange for other games, but feels pretty par the course for this one, developer Build A Rocket Boy's now denied that it's been using bots to say nice things about MindsEye. This wasn't totally out of the blue. Some folks had spotted some posts about the game with suspiciously similar wording. ""Taking a minute to set the record straight and refute this, and other false claims that are swirling,"" the studio tweeted in response to a thread that saw journos Mike Channell and Kirk McKeand highlight some examples of potentially botty MindsEye posting. ""BARB has never used any bots nor will we. We’re pumped to see players loving the latest MindsEye update! #NoBots"". Cor, a hashtag and everything. As a, well, a social media weirdness masochist for lack of a better term, I decided to look into the examples cited by Channell and McKeand myself. I also quickly checked to see if I could find more examples of multiple posts about MindsEye that use weirdly similar language - such as all insisting that the game's given them goosebumps, before casually listing the different systems you can play it on in a manner that's not at all sales-pitchy. Hey both, thanks for flagging. Taking a minute to set the record straight and refute this, and other false claims that are swirling. BARB has never used any bots nor will we. We’re pumped to see players loving the latest MindsEye update!  #NoBots Quick scans through the comments and Twitter replies on IGN and Eurogamer's MindsEye reviews - with two comments that are exactly the same left in the Facebook comments on the latter having kicked off Channell's thread - didn't reveal anything I'd class as sticking out beyond the norms I'd expect from your average internet comments section.
 Looking into the post histories of the accounts in the goosebumps-citing post chain McKeand shared a screenshot of, I did find that two of them have only existed since April this year, and that the former also retweeted one of the latter's weird MindsEye posts. Meanwhile, one put out four very similar and very promo-y posts about Mindseye across June 11th and 12th alone, all of which hype it up and mention the platforms it's available on. It even retweeted one of them in that same timeframe. Based on the few examples I looked at, I'd say this feels like it could pretty easily just be your standard weird engagement-farming bot activity done in isolation, rather than the potential astroturfing suggested in the original thread. And again, BARB have denied it.

More info. With the release of stable Android 16 to all of the Pixel owners who weren’t a part of the beta program, we sort of expected to hear some complaints. Things change with new Android versions, big updates often mess with settings or apps, and people are generally opposed to changes if they bring any sort of inconvenience to their old way of life. But man, this Android 16 update, which I’d argue is relatively minor, sure has ruffled some feathers. Android 16 update problems on Pixel phones: Earlier this week, a reddit thread popped up with one Pixel owner claiming that they were “giving up Pixel as [their] primary device” because the Android 16 update has created “an absolutely inconsistent and unreliable experience” as a device they use for work. They shared several issues they had, most of which sound like modem and connectivity problems, but they seemed to reach a new peak after receiving Android 16. In their reddit thread, they opened by acknowledging the chance to “receive a lot of downvotes” for the complaints, but that didn’t happen at all. In fact, the thread has over 600 upvotes at this point, almost 500 comments, and plenty of folks sharing similar frustrations with Android 16. I’ve got to admit that I’m a bit surprised to see this kind of thread. I’ve been on Android 16 through developer previews and all of the betas and found it to be mostly good. I do recall having notification delays on the regular, not-great battery life, and weird brightness issues. Google attempted to take care of some of that in the stable build, according to their list of fixes. I couldn’t confirm those fixes since I’m now on QPR1 builds, but it sure seems like there are lingering issues. One of the top comments (almost 300 upvotes) lists 6 items that they claim weren’t there before Android 16 and that they are seeing the issues on a Pixel 9 Pro XL and a Pixel 7. They mentioned odd brightness adjustments, overheating, unresponsive when tapping to wake, lock screen lag, proximity sensor issues, and random slowdowns. They do suggest that restarts temporarily fix some of the problems, but that’s not exactly a proper solution. Under that comment, the number of people confirming similar issues is much longer than you might expect. While there are folks who claim to have perfect devices that are now better with Android 16, there is a large group experiencing problems. It’s clear that many are having issues with Android 16. That said, the rest of the comments lean more towards the crowd of people that are having less issues with Android 16 or at least not seeing those we just talked through. Some offered opinions on why the OP is having problems, while others said plainly that they have “No issues at all.” Unfortunately, all of those experiencing so many bugs probably need a factory reset, which is never a fun solution. For those having issues, I’d tell them to give that a try before giving up on Pixel phones and jumping to Samsung or OnePlus or Apple, as so many claim they may now do.

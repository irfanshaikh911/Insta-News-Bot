       "       'Nintendo confirms kid Pauline will make Bananza a third-person shouter by  Michael McWhertor We already suspected that New Donk City mayor Pauline might make an appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch 2, but Nintendo just confirmed in a new Nintendo Direct the one-time-damsel-in-distress will not only show up in the game, she’ll be Donkey Kong’s co-op partner in their new adventure. Pauline will also appear as Odd Rock, a small purple gemlike gremlin cursed by enemy apes VoidCo. But she’ll also be present in human form, albeit much younger looking than we’ve seen her before. As previously theorized, the younger Pauline in Donkey Kong Bananza would logically place DK’s new adventure in the past — seemingly before the original 1982 Donkey Kong. Timeline questions aside, Pauline will serve as Donkey Kong’s charge and sidekick. Using the power of song, Pauline will be able to help DK (and players) spot hidden treasure using a sonar-like shout. She’ll also be able to use her voice in combat; Donkey Kong Bananza will feature a two-player co-op option, letting one player control Pauline’s voice using Switch 2’s mouse controls. Pauline can shout words like “YEAH!,” “WOW!,” and “BAM!,” words that become physical projectiles that will damage enemies and objects in the environment. That makes Donkey Kong Bananza a… third-person shouter. It seems that kid Pauline will bring plenty of musical flair to Donkey Kong Bananza. Nintendo’s new Direct presentation Anyway, while Nintendo’s got some explaining to do about Pauline and Donkey Kong’s history after confirming that kid Pauline will be present and playable in Bananza, there’s a lot to look forward to, gameplay-wise, in the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive. Donkey Kong Bananza will be released on Switch 2 on July 17. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. © 2025 Valnet Inc.'],\n",

      "Authorities have identified 215 victims of the Air India Flight AI-171 crash through matching DNA samples, with 198 bodies already handed over to their families, officials confirmed on Thursday (June 19, 2025).\n",
      "\n",
      "The tragic incident occurred a week ago when the London-bound aircraft, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed into a medical complex shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad on June 12. The crash claimed the lives of all but one person on board and a number of people on the ground. However, the government is yet to announce the official death toll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahmedabad Civil Hospital’s Medical Superintendent Rakesh Joshi said that the severe damage to the bodies caused by the crash and subsequent explosion necessitated DNA testing for identification. The victims whose bodies were handed over to families included 149 Indian citizens who were on the flight, seven Portuguese nationals, 32 British citizens, and one Canadian. Additionally, the remains of nine victims from the ground have also been handed over to their relatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six injured survivors remain hospitalised, and all are reported to be in stable condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigators continue to examine the black boxes and crash site to determine the cause of the disaster. Ahmedabad Commissioner of Police G.S. Malik made it clear that while the police are assisting in the investigation, technical aspects — such as analysing the black boxes — are being handled by specialised agencies. “The probe is still ongoing,” he added.\n"

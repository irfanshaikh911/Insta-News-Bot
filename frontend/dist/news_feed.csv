You can use it to easily share photos, documents, videos, audio recordings, contact cards, web links, notes and other data between iPads, iPhones and Macs. You can also use AirDrop to transfer those files to nearby contacts (as long as they have iOS or MacOS) and it works with any iOS device with iOS 7 or newer and Macs running OS X Yosemite or newer.

For a detailed explanation of how to use AirDrop, check out our guide here. But even if you follow these steps, sometimes AirDrop can fail. Here are a few possible reasons why it's not working.

Watch this: All Things Mobile: Our iPhone 16 Pro 7-Month Check-In 06:14

Bluetooth or Wi-Fi isn't on

AirDrop uses both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to discover devices and share files. So both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi need to be turned on in order for it to work. If even one of the connections is disabled, AirDrop will not work. If you're having trouble with either of these connections, you can try toggling these features off and on again. To do so, simply head to Settings or Control Center and enable both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Personal Hotspot is enabled

If your phone or tablet's Personal Hotspot feature is turned on, that might prevent AirDrop from working. Make sure that's disabled and make sure that the other device also has it turned off. A VPN connection might also create issues with AirDrop. If you're using a VPN, make sure that local networking is allowed. Otherwise, try disabling it in case you're having issues with AirDrop.

You can double-check your AirDrop settings from the Control Center using these menus. Nicole Lee/CNET

AirDrop is set to Receiving Off

Another reason AirDrop might not be working is that your AirDrop settings are incorrect. If you have it as ""Receiving Off,"" no one can AirDrop files to you. To correct this, you need to do the following:

It’s the latest company heading to the far north to tap into abundant green energy and natural cooling for power-hungry data centres.

The facility will be located in the Norwegian coastal town of Narvik, which lies 220km within the Arctic Circle. Aker’s president and CEO, Øyvind Eriksen said that the site already had access to 230MW of power and was ready for construction to commence. He added that discussions with potential tech firms and partners for the project were ongoing.

However, Eriksen provided limited details on the facility’s purpose, stating it will “serve as a catalyst for industrial development, job creation, and export revenues.”

“AI and data centres are becoming foundational to global business, and northern Norway is uniquely positioned to benefit,” said Eriksen. “The region offers abundant, affordable hydropower and clean energy, along with the conditions needed to attract investment and foster innovation.”

Aker, which is majority-owned by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke, has a number of AI and software investments under its belt, including in Bitcoin investment firm Seetee and industrial data company Cognite. Eriksen said the AI facility in Narvik would represent an opportunity to “enter a new value chain early.”

Bits meet blizzards

The Nordic region is fast becoming a global hotspot for AI data infrastructure. Last year, Google committed another €1bn to its Hamina campus in southern Finland, marking its seventh expansion. The data centre upgrade aims to support surging demand for AI compute while tapping into the region’s large supplies of renewable energy.

Not far away, Amsterdam-based Nebius announced in October that it’s tripling GPU capacity at its Mäntsälä site in Sweden, where it aims to run 60,000 GPUs for AI applications.

Also in Sweden, Microsoft bet $3.2bn (€2.7bn) to boost its cloud and AI capacity across its three data c"
Here’s your first look at Google Translate’s Conversation mode redesign (APK teardown),Google's bold new look for Translate app will bring flashy visuals — and deeper AI smarts — to conversations.,https://www.androidauthority.com/google-translate-conversation-mode-redesign-apk-teardown-3578323/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-translate.jpg,Technology,"Rita El Khoury / Android Authority

TL;DR Google is set to revamp the Google Translate app’s Conversation mode, featuring Gemini-based branding and smarter AI integration.

Updates include clearer speaker identification, quick language-switch chips, inline translations, and visual tweaks across automatic and manual modes.

Some settings, like toggling manual modes, are now hidden, reducing immediate accessibility.

Google has been working on significant UI updates to the Translate app to better accommodate its upcoming AI-driven features like Insights, Regional variants, Ask a Question, and Practice. But that’s not the only part of the app getting a UI refresh, as we’ve now spotted more changes slated for Google Translate, this time targeting the Conversation mode.

An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.

Google Translate v9.13.97 includes code that overhauls Google Translate’s Conversation mode in various ways. We managed to activate the upcoming changes to give you an early look.

Starting with the main Conversation mode screen, the more straightforward UI is making way for a richer one.

Current Upcoming

In the new UI, we see a prominent “Built with ✦Gemini” branding on the screen, along with a subtle disclaimer at the bottom that generative AI can make mistakes. There are also a few suggestion chips for quickly changing the language of the second speaker, and we reckon these could change depending on the user’s region. There’s a new button for turning auto-playback on and off, which previously needed going into the settings icon on the top right.

"Don’t be duped: Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile’s cheapest plans aren’t worth it",You might want to pass on an entry-level postpaid plan from one of the big three carriers.,https://www.androidauthority.com/verizon-att-t-mobile-entry-level-plans-not-worth-it-3570833/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Phones-showing-Verizon-ATT-and-T-Mobile-logos-stock-photo-4.jpg,Technology,"Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Recently, my cousin asked me whether Verizon’s myPlan Unlimited Welcome was better than his legacy plan, prompted by a promotional email he received. At first glance, the new plan looked cheaper and similar in features. But upon closer examination, his legacy plan had notable advantages, especially higher-priority data and a few other perks.

Truthfully, none of the entry-level postpaid plans from Verizon, T-Mobile, or AT&T offer great value in 2025. There are typically better alternatives, regardless of how appealing the carriers make these entry-level plans appear.

Is an entry-level postpaid plan worth it in 2025? 0 votes Yes, it's still cheaper than other postpaid plans. NaN % No, it's better to go with a more expensive postpaid plan. NaN % No, it's better to go with prepaid. NaN % Undecided / Other (Tell us in comments) NaN %

Historically, basic postpaid plans closely mirrored higher-tier plans, minus perks and sometimes data prioritization. Unfortunately, that’s not so true anymore, and yet most customers don’t really understand the differences until it’s too late and they’ve switched off their existing plan.

With that in mind, I wanted to take a closer look at what you’ll be missing with an entry-level plan, as well as what you’re alternatives are.

What you’ll miss out on with entry-level plans from the big three

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T all offer a fairly similar experience when it comes to their entry-level plans. You’ll get unlimited talk, text, and data, but virtually nothing else beyond that, save for a few smaller perks like Verizon Access and T-Mobile Tuesdays. AT&T and T-Mobile also offer hotspot access, with the former providing 5GB of high-speed access and the latter providing unlimited 3G speeds.

As for what you’ll be missing out on compared to more expensive prepaid plans? There are actually a few things. For starters, you’re not going to find international calling o"
4 Ways Technical Leaders Can Build Smart in Lean Times,"The key lies in striking the right balance between innovation and efficiency, making smarter &quot;build vs buy&quot; decisions, and organizing for AI-driven productivity without sacrificing long-term progress.",https://www.informationweek.com/it-leadership/4-ways-technical-leaders-can-build-smart-in-lean-times,InformationWeek,https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/blt9ba8af94ed024676/682b6c9b56e4a1d61b5d62c6/leader_concept-Christian_Horz_-alamy.jpg?width=1280&auto=webp&quality=80&disable=upscale,Technology,"In today’s uncertain economic environment, enterprise CIOs and CTOs are under tremendous pressure to do more with less. Budgets are tightening. R&D spend is under scrutiny. Hiring freezes mean teams must be stretched further. Add in the disruption and promise of AI, and technical leaders are operating in an environment that demands boldness, innovation, and speed.

Despite today’s headwinds, the mission of technical leaders remains unchanged. They still must scale transformative initiatives, deliver measurable business value, and keep their organizations nimble and resilient. The key lies in striking the right balance between innovation and efficiency, making smarter ""build vs buy"" decisions, and organizing for AI-driven productivity without sacrificing long-term progress.

Know What Matters and What Doesn’t

In economic downturns, technical debt can quietly become your biggest liability. CEOs don’t want to hear about tech debt. They want outcomes. That’s why ruthless prioritization and good hygiene are critical. Focus on what matters most and say no to anything that doesn’t directly tie to business value.

That doesn’t translate to trading quality for quantity. Reserve that mindset only for early-stage proofs of concept. Focus on fewer, more impactful projects that align with strategic priorities. Every new tool or process should pass the litmus test of solving a real business problem while integrating logically, scaling sustainably, and delivering value in a measurable way. Identify and prioritize near-term wins that drive clear business value, like those that improve reliability, reduce cost, and unlock growth.

Poorly integrated systems force customers to iteratively reenter information as they get routed from station to station in a phone call.

Automated billing systems bill twice.

Chat functions take you down paths of no return when all you wanted was a simple answer.

When these things happen, systems get blamed and so does IT.

How can CIOs change digital projects so that both humans and digital automation can take their best steps forward?

1. Reimagine digital project engineering so it includes usability

When we think about digital project engineering, the goal is to design hardware and software and ensure that these components fit together into a cohesive system. The focus is on the technical, with only secondary attention being paid to the human usability of the project.

Assumptions going into a digital project are that it is naturally going to make life easier for users and save money for the company, yet consultancies like McKinsey say that there is a 70% failure rate for digital projects.

One contributing factor to digital project failure is usability. Usability problems show up in the excessive abandon rates of automated phone attendants, in websites that have complicated chats, or in internal business process automation that renders everyday work to become more, not less, complex.

All of these undesirable outcomes can be avoided if digital project engineering includes human usability upfront.

2. Implement human factors engineering

In April, the Pentagon canceled $5.1 billion worth of third-party information technology and consulting contracts that it deemed “wasteful” and “non-essential spending.” The memorandum detailing the contract terminations singled out three companies that are listed among the federal government’s 10 highest paid consulting firms.

These actions on tariffs and contracts represent two sides of the same coin. President Trump intends for tariffs to promote American manufacturing, create American jobs and spark a reshoring boom. By nixing consulting contracts, the Department of Defense is sending a related message to multinational system integrators (historically some of the biggest culprits of moving American jobs offshore): If you wish to continue doing business with the federal government, you must invest in more US workers.

Accenture, headquartered in Dublin, is a multinational behemoth with 774,000 employees working in offices and operations in 52 countries. Nearly 40% of its employees are based in India, while only 10% are in the US. Deloitte, headquartered in London, has nearly 40% of its 460,000 employees in the US, but its stated offshoring goal is to have roughly 30% of its entire workforce operating from India.

This will surprise some people. My company, Kayrros, was the world’s first to track and attribute methane globally. We were cited when John Kerry announced the Global Methane Pledge, and we played a role in shaping the EU’s 2024 methane law. We have worked with countless organisations to monitor greenhouse gas emissions and other climate events — deforestation and wildfire spread, for example — and numerous businesses keen to reduce their carbon footprint. Surely, unregulated AI means an explosion in energy use and the creation of fuel-hungry data centres?

Here is my concern. The European Commission, in its zeal to pass the first major piece of AI regulation — and for the best of reasons, I should add — is missing the wood for the trees. Yes, we need guardrails. Yes, we need AI to be ethical and human-centred. Yes, AI is powerful, and powerful technologies have a way of developing in unpredictable ways. And yes, less regulation means more AI deployment, which means more energy use. But the AI Act is still a mistake.

First, AI will make industries vastly more efficient, reducing emissions for years to come. As Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has pointed out, once created, AI models perform tasks far more efficiently than traditional computing methods. For example, an AI weather model can forecast over 1,000 times more efficiently than conventional techniques can. Thus, whatever energy is invested in AI is repaid, with change, as the model is reused.

The technology, developed by UK startup Seabound, is billed as the world’s first commercial carbon capture system for boats. It’s installed on the UBC Cork, a cement carrier owned by Germany’s Hartmann Group.

“These are the systems we intend to scale across hundreds, and eventually thousands, of vessels,” Alisha Frediksson, Seabound’s CEO and co-founder, told TNW. “We’re therefore very excited to get them out into the world — to gather valuable data, optimise future iterations, and most importantly, to show the industry that onboard carbon capture is no longer just a concept.”

Seabound co-founder Alsiha Fredriksson (left) with fellow co-founder and CTO Roujia Wen. Credit: Seabound

Seabound’s carbon capture equipment traps the exhaust gas produced by the vessel’s huge diesel engines and funnels it into a big, high-pressure chamber filled with calcium hydroxide pebbles.

The CO2 in the exhaust gas reacts with the pebbles and transforms into calcium carbonate — also known as limestone, the key ingredient in cement. That limestone is stored onboard and will be offloaded in Norway, where it will be delivered to Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant in Brevik. There, it will be used to produce greener concrete on an industrial scale as part of Heidelberg’s existing carbon capture facility.

Seabound claims its system can capture up to 95% of CO₂ and 98% of sulphur emissions from a ship’s exhaust. Its modular design allows it to be bolted onto existing vessels with minimal changes. It offers the shipping industry a way to cut emissions immediately — but it can’t replace the long-term need for cleaner fuels to replace diesel altogether.

WeTransfer users discovered this week that the service had updated its policy with a clause granting it a perpetual, royalty‑free license to use user‑uploaded content, including for “improving machine learning models that enhance content moderation.” The changes were due to come into effect on August 8.

The proposed engine for the plane is based on so-called pre-cooler technology, developed over decades by UK aerospace firm Reaction Engines, which went bust in November.

Many of Reaction Engines’ top engineers found a new home at British aerospace and defence company Frazer-Nash Consultancy, which is now leading the Invictus consortium. Other members of the group include US aircraft maker Spirit AeroSystems and Britain’s Cranfield University.

Invictus aims to develop a reusable hypersonic vehicle capable of flying at Mach 5 (6174 km/h) — five times the speed of sound. Unlike most rockets, this spaceplane would take off horizontally from a runway. The plane would skim the edge of space, then return and land like a commercial jet. Powered by hydrogen, the aircraft promises lower emissions and longer endurance than traditional jet fuel engines.

The first stage of the programme, funded by €7mn from ESA’s General Support Technology Programme, plans to deliver a concept design by mid-2026. The design will centre around the plane’s hydrogen-fuelled, air-breathing propulsion system.

The pre-cooler is a heat exchanger that cools incoming air before it hits the engine. At hypersonic speeds, air entering the engine can reach thousands of degrees, too hot for traditional turbines. The precooler rapidly chills this air using cold hydrogen fuel running through tiny pipes.

The system is designed to counter the extreme heat caused by shock and friction at hypersonic speeds, allowing engines to run safely. Reaction Engines’ ground tests last year showed promising results when integrated with jet "
Zack Snyder Can’t Let ‘Rebel Moon’ Die,"A new game was just released, and the 'Justice League' director seems open to more movies, too.",https://gizmodo.com/zack-snyder-cant-let-rebel-moon-die-2000630192,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/Rebel-Moon-part-2.jpg,Technology,"Remember Rebel Moon? Netflix’s two-part movie series created by Zack Snyder, released in late 2023 and early 2024, which then had two longer, bloodier versions released that same year? Snyder’s answer to Star Wars, in which he created his own sci-fi world from the ground up? Ring a bell? If not, that’s because they did well on the streamer but didn’t quite resonate culturally like most probably hoped. Nevertheless, it seems Snyder isn’t ready to give up on the franchise just yet.

Case in point, Netflix just released Blood Line, a co-op campaign action game set in the Rebel Moon universe. More importantly, though, Snyder is leaving the door open to make more movies. “I got sidetracked into this—not sidetracked, it’s all uptown problems, as they say—for Netflix, I’m working on an LAPD SWAT movie,” Snyder told Variety. “So I was like, ‘Okay, well, I’m gonna just sort of let that Rebel Moon world boil for a minute, and I’m gonna go do this.’ And frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it. I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break. So yeah, we’ll see after I finish this, when I come back, where we are with everything.”

So it seems like a cop movie now, and maybe Rebel Moon later. Maybe. As for what it would be about, Snyder said it could be anything. “There’s tons of stories,” he said. “So, I mean, I think it’s literally, it’s endless. But, again, like I say, I’m waiting to see how we want to and in what way we would move forward, if at all.”

“If at all” obviously makes it seem like maybe Rebel Moon is dead but, also, not. Personally, I think it was admirable that Snyder took such a big swing with the two, turned into four, sci-fi epics, but, frankly, they stunk. Do something else. Let it go. We just aren’t sure he can.

7 Weird Sci-Fi Network TV Shows That Aired Just as Streaming Was Taking Over,"Ah, the mid-2010s—Netflix and other streamers were on the rise, but old-school TV networks were still taking chances on offbeat genre shows.",https://gizmodo.com/7-weird-sci-fi-network-tv-shows-that-aired-just-as-streaming-was-taking-over-2000629439,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/almosthuman.jpg,Technology,"Netflix’s first original series, House of Cards, launched in 2013, and television was never the same. But even as Netflix and other platforms began to gain popularity, old-school network and basic cable channels continued to create edgy (and sometimes a bit unhinged) genre shows—the sort of programming that just a few years later would come to dominate the streaming landscape.

With that in mind, here are seven weird and wonderful sci-fi shows from the last era of TV before streaming well and truly took over.

Wayward Pines (2015-2018, Fox)

M. Night Shyamalan directed the pilot episode and served as executive producer on this adaptation of author Blake Crouch’s sci-fi mystery trilogy. Wayward Pines starts off as a sort of Twin Peaks riff—a federal agent (Matt Dillon) stumbles his way into a small town full of secretive people while looking for his missing partner.

Then comes the twist: it’s actually the 41st century, and everyone in the town is there because they were placed in cryosleep ahead of the apocalypse. In the intervening thousands of years, mutated humans took over the planet, and the barrier between 21st-century people and far-future “Abbies” (short for “aberrations”) is weakening by the day. Along the way, the show digs into some classic sci-fi questions, including “Who are the real monsters?”

Wayward Pines—whose cast included Carla Gugino, Toby Jones, Juliette Lewis, Melissa Leo, and Djimon Hounsou—ran for two seasons. Shyamalan’s next TV venture was Servant at Apple TV+, the same streamer hosting Crouch’s current project, an adaptation of his book Dark Matter. But you can still visit the roaring 4020s: Wayward Pines is streaming on Hulu; it also got a physical release.

Zoo (2015-2017, CBS)

For three seasons, viewers followed along as a ragtag group of reluctant heroes—a zoologist (James Wolk), a journalist (Kristen Connelly), a safari guide (Nonso Anozie), a French intelligence agent (Nora Arnezeder), and a veterinary pathologist (Billy Burke)—nav"
Mattel’s New ‘Wicked: For Good’ Toys Give Us a Spoilery Glimpse at the ‘Wizard of Oz’ Crew,Glinda and Elphaba are the stars of Mattel's new dolls—but the new toys also tease just how 'For Good' will adapt the musical's second act.,https://gizmodo.com/mattels-new-wicked-for-good-toys-give-us-a-spoilery-glimpse-at-the-wizard-of-oz-crew-2000630251,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/Wicked-for-good-Mattel-Dorothy-Glinda.jpg,Technology,"Let us be glad; let us be grateful for these first looks at one tornado-swept girl and her yellow brick road pals in Wicked: For Good. That’s right, Wicked merch drop Wednesdays return for us Ozian fans, and this time give us clues as to Dorothy Gale’s look in Jon M. Chu’s fall sequel to Wicked, which will incorporate the Wizard of Oz arc we’ve all been waiting for.

Some spoilers ahead, as some major plot twists can’t be avoided once you see more of the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and outfit reveals for Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda (Ariana Grande) as the Good Witch of Oz.

Let’s start with the shoes; they’re clearly no longer on Nessarose Thropp’s feet. That means we can assume the de facto Munchkinland mayor, who becomes known as the Wicked Witch of the East, has, er, been bodied by way of a Kansas shack to the face. The Mattel doll of Dorothy brings back the iconic blue checked dress and pigtail braids for the teen. And yet it still leaves us guessing who might be playing her.

Dorothy wears the shoes that once belonged to Nessarose and Elphaba’s mother and that may or may not have magical properties. As fans of the classic storybook lore as well as the MGM technicolor film starring Judy Garland, we know the shoes—now silver as originally described in L. Frank Baum’s works—are going to start an all-out war between the witches and the Wizard of Oz.

Then there’s the most scandlocious of reveals in Wicked: For Good, one that musical fans are well aware of and have been holding in (you’re welcome). It’s a surprising plot twist that Dorothy’s friends are people we have already met and have a bone to pick with Elphaba too. After getting caught in the crossfire of Oz witch drama, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) and Boq (Ethan Slater) get turned into the Scarecrow and Tin Man, with the lion from part one having grown into the final member of the yellow brick road gang. And yes, Toto is there too.

Wicked: For Good feels so far away, but these toy "
A Top Engineer Reveals OpenAI’s Culture of Secrets and Chaos,"A former top engineer reveals an organization that runs on secrets, Slack messages, and social media buzz, where world changing AI is built through a combination of brilliance, burnout, and controlled chaos.",https://gizmodo.com/a-top-engineer-reveals-openais-culture-of-secrets-and-chaos-2000630478,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/08/chatgpt-iran-linked-election-influence-openai.jpg,Technology,"Calvin French-Owen only worked at OpenAI for a year, but he saw more in twelve months than most engineers do in a lifetime. As a successful founder turned employee, he joined the world’s leading artificial intelligence company in May 2024 and left in June 2025. What he walked into was not a typical corporate tech job. It was a startup strapped to a rocket ship, powered by GPUs, Slack notifications, and a culture of secrecy that makes Apple look like an open book.

“The first thing to know about OpenAI is how quickly it’s grown,” French-Owen writes in a long, revealing blog post published on July 15. “When I joined, the company was a little over 1,000 people. One year later, it is over 3,000 and I was in the top 30% by tenure.”

That kind of explosive growth, known in Silicon Valley as hypergrowth, breaks everything: communication, team structures, hiring, and product planning. And yet, OpenAI keeps shipping groundbreaking tools like ChatGPT and its AI coding assistant, Codex. How?

According to French-Owen, the company functions as a chaotic, bottom up meritocracy, valuing speed over structure and individual initiative over rigid planning. The entire operation, he reveals, runs on a single communication tool.

“Everything, and I mean everything, runs on Slack. There is no email,” he wrote. “I maybe received ~10 emails in my entire time there.”

This means that critical decisions, technical documentation, debates, and even leadership directives all happen in fast moving, ephemeral chat threads. If you miss a key message, you might miss a product launch.

Building Without a Blueprint

While outsiders might assume OpenAI operates with meticulous, long term planning, French-Owen says the truth is far messier and more improvisational.

“When I first showed up, I started asking questions about the roadmap for the next quarter. The answer I got was: ‘this doesn’t exist’,” he wrote. Instead of a top down master plan, ideas bubble up from individual researchers and engineers"
Trump’s Meme Coin Empire Is About to Explode With Millions of New Tokens,Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they?,https://gizmodo.com/trumps-meme-coin-empire-is-about-to-explode-with-millions-of-new-tokens-2000630543,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/trump_memecoin.jpg,Technology,"Millions of Trump meme coins could flood the crypto market starting this week, potentially reshaping the future of one of the most controversial cryptocurrencies in circulation.

Entities affiliated with President Donald Trump now have the right to sell a large portion of the meme coin named after him, $TRUMP, starting Wednesday July 17. The move could unlock hundreds of millions of dollars in digital tokens, intensifying scrutiny over Trump’s growing involvement in crypto and raising fresh questions about potential conflicts of interest.

The Meme Coin With Presidential Backing

The $TRUMP token launched on January 17, just three days before Trump officially returned to the White House. A total of 1 billion $TRUMP tokens were created, but only 200 million have been circulating in the market. The remaining 800 million, or 80 percent of the total supply, are held by two entities: CIC Digital LLC, a Trump Organization affiliate, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, another company tied to the former president, according to the official $TRUMP website gettrumpmemes.com.

A vesting schedule outlined on the site allows the token creators to gradually release more of the supply over a three-year period.

Back in April, CIC and its partners were permitted to sell up to 40 million tokens but chose not to. As of July 17, they are authorized to sell an additional 50 million. That brings the total available for sale to 90 million $TRUMP tokens, almost half of the current circulating supply.

At current market price of $10.06, those tokens are worth more than $900 million.

Justin Sun Says He’s Buying. But Has He?

So far, it is unclear whether Trump-linked entities plan to sell. But one potential buyer has already stepped up: crypto billionaire Justin Sun.

“We are committed to buying $100M of $TRUMP! Together, $TRUMP and #TRON are the future of Crypto,” Sun posted on X on July 9.

“This move highlights our belief in collaborating across ecosystems to grow the crypto landscape with comm"

The studio has provided support on a number of large game projects — including a recent patch for Cyberpunk 2077 — and employs over 4,200 people across the US, Europe and Asia.

The brunt of the layoffs are happening to Virtuos employees in China, where Andres reports that around 200 positions are being eliminated. Virtuos' teams in France, who were primarily responsible for the surprise release of Oblivion Remastered back in April, are also expected to be impacted.

Besides reviving Bethesda classics, Virtuos has contributed work to the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and several ongoing live service games, like Dune: Awakening and Sea of Thieves. Nothing about the company's output or the critical reception of its games would suggest it needs to conduct layoffs, but that reflects the current precarious state of the games industry. Even having theoretically steady work doing post-release support and game remasters isn't enough.

Virtuos' layoffs follows the sweeping cuts Microsoft made to its Xbox division in early July. Microsoft reportedly cancelled games, like Rare's long-in-development Everwild, and shutdown whole studios, like The Initiative. Romero Games, which had an unannounced funding deal with Microsoft, was also forced to cancel its current project, though it hopes to find a new publishing partner."

The second big Switch 2 tentpole title comes from the team that made Super Mario Odyssey. The developers explained how they laid the foundation for DK's first 3D adventure since the Nintendo 64 era.

Destruction is at the heart of Donkey Kong Bananza. Everything in his environment can be smashed to bits. Not only is that a fun mechanic, but it also adds an element of verticality and freedom of exploration. That's an ideal fit for showcasing the Switch 2's processing power.

Nintendo

As with so many other Nintendo creations, the first step in getting there was a no-brainer. Consult with Shigeru Miyamoto.

""We'd built up a lot of expertise in gameplay development for 3D action games through our work on 3D Mario games, including Super Mario Odyssey,"" producer Kenta Motokura said. ""But we needed to dive deeper into the fundamental question of 'What is Donkey Kong?' So, our first step was to seek out Miyamoto-san and Nintendo Executive Officer Yoshiaki Koizumi.""

In their talk, Miyamoto emphasized DK's moves like hand slaps and blowing. Along similar lines, Koizumi pointed to the ape's massive arms, which he uses to punch and hoist heavy objects. That got the team thinking. After all, who doesn't want to control a giant ape who runs around, breaking shit?

The Super Mario Odyssey team was uniquely suited to handle that challenge. First, the 2017 title included some light environmental destruction. (Think the cheese rocks in the Luncheon Kingdom and Bowser's smashing in the final level.)

The team experimented with fully destructible environments soon after Odyssey's release. (That was long before they knew they'd make a Donkey Kong game.) That included the adorably strange idea of putting smashing fists on a Goomba and se"

The proposed rules will apply to any company on the FCC's existing list of entities that pose ""an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.""

Besides ""prohibiting the use of 'covered' equipment,"" the FCC's new rules will also limit the ability for Chinese companies to receive a license to build or operate cables that connect to the US. Undersea or submarine cables are a key piece of internet infrastructure, and a potential site of foreign espionage in the eyes of the FCC. Banning, or at least severely limiting the influence of Chinese companies is an attempt to benefit American cable providers while hurting the country's perceived enemies.

During President Donald Trump's first term, the FCC made similar moves to prevent mobile carriers from using Chinese equipment in the US. Trump signed a law that required carriers to ""rip and replace"" old Huawei and ZTE mobile infrastructure, and the FCC provisioned funding to make it happen. The new rules around undersea cables are being proposed by a very different commission, though.

Currently, there are only three commissioners on the FCC, down from the typical five. Under Carr, the commission has taken a much more aggressive approach to regulating the telecommunications industry, bordering on violating the First Amendment. Carr has threatened to investigate companies for their diversity, equity and inclusion policies and committed to not approving any mergers of companies that insist on keeping them.

The FCC is expected to vote on the new rules on August 7. Besides being consistent with past FCC actions, they could be justified as a way of securing American infrastructure following the widespread ""Salt Typhoon"" hack the affected US carriers and other companies last year."

You may also have heard of the term ""cortisol face"" or ""moon face,"" which can be attributed to high cortisol levels.

""Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that helps regulate your metabolism, blood sugar, inflammation, blood pressure and sleep-wake cycle,"" explains Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and CMO of Function Health, which offers a cortisol lab test. ""It's most known for managing the body's response to stress.""

But what exactly does a cortisol imbalance look like, and how does it affect the body? To find out, we consulted doctors for symptoms, causes, when to see a doctor for cortisol testing and how to regulate cortisol.

What is cortisol?

""Cortisol is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands in response to stress,"" says Dr. Fady Hannah Shmouni, medical director at Eli Health, which sells an instant cortisol test. ""When a stressful situation arises, cortisol can help your body prepare to respond by increasing energy, focus or alertness.""

Shmouni states that in the short term, your body's cortisol response is necessary and helpful. However, chronic stress can cause cortisol to remain elevated, which can negatively affect your organs, including your brain. For instance, elevated cortisol can disrupt sleep, increase inflammation or impair memory.

Dr. Andy Franklyn-Miller, a dual board-certified sports and exercise medicine physician, adds that cortisol is like your body's built-in alarm system and is often called the ""stress hormone.""

""Cortisol is part of the glucocorticoid family, and it's released as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, your body's stress response headquarters,"" Franklyn-Miller says. In the morning, your cortisol spikes to help you get moving. At night, it dips to help you rest.

The short answer is yes, but the long answer is a bit more complicated. I spoke with several experts, including CNET's Laboratory Technical Project Manager Gianmarco Chumbe, to find out everything you need to know about how Wi-Fi travels. It's a simple question, but it has a big impact on whether your Wi-Fi connection is slow.

""As with any radio signal, attenuation occurs when waves pass through materials like brick, concrete or metal -- or simply over increasing distance,"" Chumbe said. He should know -- our CNET Labs team has spent countless hours testing internet routers for the latest version of our Best Wi-Fi routers page.

With the introduction of Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E and the latest standard, Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi technology has steadily improved in recent years. An adequate Wi-Fi connection is necessary, yet many people still struggle with their home internet: In a recent CNET broadband survey, 42% of respondents complained about having an unreliable connection.

Many possible factors contribute to an unreliable internet connection, but when it comes to Wi-Fi, there are quick fixes to boost the Wi-Fi connection throughout your home. To optimize your Wi-Fi connection and understand how the technology interacts with the structure of your home, you need to understand how Wi-Fi actually works.

Back to the basics

Wi-Fi, also known as Wireless Fidelity, is a wireless technology that allows your router to exchange data with multiple devices. This data is transmitted through radio waves. According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the first version of Wi-Fi was released in 1997 under the 802 family of standards for local area networks. The IEEE designates Wi-Fi as 802.11.

I tested a new browser that makes Chrome feel outdated,Perplexity's Comet brings the future of autonomous AI a bit closer to us normies.,https://www.androidauthority.com/perplexity-comet-hands-on-3577968/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Perplexity-Comet-hero-1-scaled.jpeg,Technology,"Karandeep Singh / Android Authority

AI is embedding itself into every nook of our digital lives faster than Elon Musk can type his next obnoxious tweet. First, it was an app that could talk to you in a natural voice. Then it spread to everyday voice assistants. And now, it’s coming — strong-armed — for our main work app: web browsers.

Google is pushing hard to make Gemini a core part of Chrome. The makers of Arc have already moved on to an AI-first browser. OpenAI is rumored to be working on its own Chrome alternative. But in one corner, Perplexity — the AI search engine that wants to replace Google — has quietly launched its own browser, Comet, with limited availability.

I got to use an early version of its Mac app. And I have thoughts. A lot of thoughts. Mostly, though, using Perplexity’s Comet feels like I just touched the future — the one we’ve been dreaming of.

Back to the future

Karandeep Singh / Android Authority

I realize the weight of repurposing an iconic movie title, and I do that with utmost sincerity. Comet feels otherworldly. Something… perplexing for real (geddit?). And I’ll tell you how.

When I first got access to Comet, I assumed it was yet another browser with an AI sidebar (which it does have) that helps you with translations, summaries, and other basic stuff using the current webpage. But Comet baffled me — in the best way — right from the first step.

We’ve all been waiting for the reality where AI does stuff for us. We’re partially there — Gemini, for example, integrates across Google services so you can ask it to add calendar entries using email context or generate music playlists based on your mood. But Comet takes things a couple of notches higher. It navigates websites, learns on the go if it fails, reattempts, verifies its actions, and does tasks on your behalf — all unsupervised.

"Embattled retro gaming YouTuber shares update, launches new channel",This might be the final update amid the ongoing legal battle.,https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-update-3578359/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Once-Were-Nerd-YouTuber.jpg,Technology,"TL;DR Once Were Nerd, the Italian YouTuber under fire for reviewing handhelds, has shared an update on his channel.

The case is still active, but authorities have already requested his channel be shut down.

YouTube is reviewing the case, but he has proactively created a new channel.

The retro gaming community has rallied behind the embattled Italian YouTuber Once Were Nerd, who faces a massive fine and possible jail time for reviewing emulation handhelds with pre-loaded ROMs. He has now posted a short update amid the media frenzy, although it may be his last.

In a YouTube Short embedded below, Once Were Nerd creator Francesco Salicini thanked his followers for their support, and revealed that authorities have already requested that his channels be taken down. This includes not just his website and YouTube channel, but also his Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and Telegram.

While his website is already unavailable for many users in Italy, YouTube is still reviewing the case. He has removed all videos covering ANBERNIC handhelds, but his stance is still that he didn’t break any community guidelines. There are countless other YouTubers reviewing the same products, many of which are readily available on Amazon Italy, complete with pre-loaded ROMs.

Still, he has taken the proactive step of creating a second channel in case his first is shut down. He would lose over 220 videos and nearly 50,000 subscribers, but at least he can continue his career as a YouTuber. At the moment, the second channel doesn’t have any uploads, but if things continue to escalate, that’s where you can find future updates.

That said, Francesco did mention that he has to be careful with what he says. Anything he says can be used against him in court, so his lawyers have advised him to avoid giving more details about the case.

Ultimately, his main wish is for all of this to blow over so he can get back to creating YouTube videos for his followers.

Why Google’s August 20 event could make or break its Pixel lineup,The Tensor G5 — not the Pixel 10 series — is the real star of Google's August 20 event.,https://www.androidauthority.com/google-august-20-event-make-or-break-pixel-lineup-3578172/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-and-Pixel-9-Pro-backs.jpg,Technology,"Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Pixel fans, our time has almost come. Yesterday, Google confirmed that its next Made by Google event is scheduled for August 20, and it’s on this date that we’ll see Google’s latest batch of Pixel hardware.

Although Google hasn’t officially said what it’s announcing, we have a good idea of what to expect. On August 20, Google is likely to announce the Pixel 10 series — consisting of the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We should also see the Pixel Watch 4, a new pair of Pixel Buds, and more.

However, while all of that is great, none of it is what I’m most interested to see. If you’re a Pixel fan like me, the real reason to look forward to August 20 is Google’s new Tensor G5 chip. Because, depending on how good or bad the chip is, it could make or break this year’s Pixel lineup.

August 20 is all about the Tensor G5

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

As is usually the case for Made by Google events, Google will likely spend much of August 20 talking about its new smartphones. We’ll probably hear Google go on and on about its refined designs, eye-friendly display technology, new camera features, Gemini updates, and so on. And that’s all important! But the thing that really matters is the chipset powering this year’s Pixel family.

If the rumors are true, the Pixel 10 series will be powered by Google’s new Tensor G5. That in of itself isn’t surprising (we expect a new Tensor chip every year), but there are two key details that should make the G5 stand out: 1. It’ll be Google’s first 3nm chip, and 2. it’s going to be the first Tensor chipset produced by TSMC instead of Samsung Foundry.

Ever since Google introduced the world to Tensor chips with the Tensor G1 in the Pixel 6 lineup, the"

The new Emoji Game was initially announced as part of iOS 26 at WWDC. The game, however, is now rolling out to all iPhone users running iOS 18.4 and later as well as iPadOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4.

Apple explains that Emoji Game “challenges players to use a selection of emoji” to fill in the blanks of short phrases with as few moves as possible. Results can be shared via Game Center, Messages, Mail, and other apps. Emoji Game will also integrate with the Apple Games app coming later this year as part of iOS 26.

Emoji Game utilizes Apple Intelligence and Genmoji. Some of the emoji characters you’ll see throughout the game were generated using the Genmoji feature; they aren’t just normal unicode emoji characters.

Here’s Apple’s full description of Emoji Game:

Emoji Game challenges players to use a selection of emoji — including Genmoji created using Apple Intelligence — to fill in the blanks of three short phrases using as few moves as possible. Each phrase is accompanied by a clue, which the user can choose to reveal, but that will count toward the player’s total number of moves. Results can be tracked on Game Center leaderboards, or shared with friends and family through Messages, Mail, social media, or other platforms. Subscribers can access daily and archived Emoji Game puzzles in the Puzzles section of the Apple News app. Apple News+ subscribers will also be able to access Emoji Game this fall through the Apple Games app, an all-new destination designed to help players jump back into the games they love, find their next favorite, and have more fun with friends.

The Emoji Game joins Apple’s other puzzle games, including the crossword, the crossword mini, Quartiles, and sudoku. Lauren Kern, editor-in-chief of Apple News:

The battle over the gas turbines powering xAI's data center began last April when thermal imaging seemed to show that the firm was lying about dozens of seemingly operational turbines that could be a major source of smog-causing pollution. By June, the NAACP got involved, notifying the Shelby County Health Department (SCHD) of its intent to sue xAI to force Elon Musk's AI company to engage with community members in historically Black neighborhoods who are believed to be most affected by the pollution risks.

But the NAACP's letter seemingly did nothing to stop the SCHD from granting the permits two weeks later on July 2, as well as exemptions that xAI does not appear to qualify for, the appeal noted. Now, the NAACP—alongside environmental justice groups; the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC); and Young, Gifted and Green—is appealing. The groups are hoping the Memphis and Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board will revoke the permit and block the exemptions, agreeing that the SCHD's decisions were fatally flawed, violating the Clean Air Act and local laws.

SCHD's permit granted xAI permission to operate 15 gas turbines at the Memphis data center, while the SELC's imaging showed that xAI was potentially operating as many as 24. Prior to the permitting, xAI was accused of operating at least 35 turbines without the best-available pollution controls.

In their appeal, the NAACP and other groups argued that the SCHD put xAI profits over Black people's health, granting unlawful exemptions while turning a blind eye to xAI's operations, which allegedly started in 2024 but were treated as brand new in 2025."

In a Tuesday update to the ""Rules and Guidelines"" section of Steam's Onboarding Documentation, the company added a new rule prohibiting ""Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or Internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.""

On its own, the new rule seems rather vague, with no details on which of the many kinds of ""adult only content"" would belong in the ""certain"" subset prohibited by these unnamed payment processors and ISPs. But the trackers over at SteamDB noticed that the publication of the new rule coincides with the removal of dozens of Steam games whose titles make reference to incest, along with a handful of sex games referencing ""slave"" or ""prison"" imagery.

Holding the keys to the bank

Valve isn't alone in having de facto restrictions on content imposed on it by outside payment processors. In 2022, for instance, Visa suspended all payments to Pornhub's ad network after the adult video site was accused of profiting from child sexual abuse materials. And PayPal has routinely disallowed payments to file-sharing sites and VPN providers over concerns surrounding piracy of copyrighted materials."

The targeted devices are end of life, meaning they no longer receive regular updates for stability and security. Despite the status, many organizations continue to rely on them. That has left them prime targets by UNC6148, the name Google has given to the unknown hacking group.

“GTIG recommends that all organizations with SMA appliances perform analysis to determine if they have been compromised,” a report published Wednesday said, using the abbreviation for Google Threat Intelligence Group. “Organizations should acquire disk images for forensic analysis to avoid interference from the rootkit anti-forensic capabilities. Organizations may need to engage with SonicWall to capture disk images from physical appliances.”

Lacking specifics

Many key details remain unknown. For one thing, the attacks are exploiting leaked local administrator credentials on the targeted devices, and so far, no one knows how the credentials were obtained. It’s also not known what vulnerabilities UNC6148 is exploiting. It’s also unclear precisely what the attackers are doing after they take control of a device.

The lack of details is largely the result of the functioning on Overstep, the name of custom backdoor malware UNC6148 is installing after initial compromise of the devices. Overstep allows the attackers to selectively remove log entries, a technique that is hindering forensic investigation. Wednesday’s report also posits that the attackers may be armed with a zero-day exploit, meaning it targets a vulnerability that’s currently publicly unknown. Possible vulnerabilities UNC6148 may be exploiting include:"

It started with the electric G Wagon, but the CLA is the first mainstream product to make the change. The thing is that the change is significant and for the better. Several months ago, we got some time in a prototype CLA; now we've driven the final product.

The CLA will be available with either one or two electric motors, with a two-speed setup for efficiency and performance. The 250+ base model makes 268 hp (200 kW) and 247 lb-ft (335 Nm) of torque. Mercedes is claiming up to 792 km of range with this model on the WLTP cycle.

As reported by The Register today, Broadcom this week revealed to VMware CSP partners that it is launching a new invite-only channel program for CSPs on November 1. Fewer CSPs are expected to be eligible for this new program. The Register said that “some mid-size partners won’t be invited to the new program.""

Current VMware CSPs that didn’t receive an invite for the new program by today have reportedly been cut and will receive a notice of non-renewal.

CSPs that are getting booted are allowed to continue conducting business as normal until October 31. Afterward, those CSPs and the organizations whose VMware-based deployments they serve will be heavily impacted. As explained by Australian IT service provider and VMware CSP Interactive, companies currently using VMware tech through a CSP that's being cut will have to find a new way to renew VMware licenses and may see “delays or confusion” amid service and renewal requests and changes to the support and service they receive. Furthermore, prices could go up since partner consolidation could lead to “additional costs for migration and re-onboarding and reduced bundling options that previously allowed for greater cost efficiencies,” Interactive said.

White-label program ending

Since acquiring VMware, Broadcom has been shrinking the number of businesses that are eligible to resell and provide support for VMware offerings. In January 2024, it replaced the old VMware partner program with an invite-only one, the Broadcom Advantage Partner Program, and shed many partners. Broadcom also cut business ties with many CSP partners by requiring CSP members of its new partner program to operate at least 3,500 processor cores. In March 2024, The Register reported that “hundreds” of CSPs weren’t invited to "

Plasma Bigscreen is a shell designed for use on televisions and other large displays, using a remote for navigation rather than mouse or keyboard. It’s been around for a while (I wrote about it in 2022) but if I’m frank—I’m not, I’m Joey—I’d forgotten it existed.

KDE developer Espi, a regular contributor to Plasma Mobile, had not.

But he found the project in a state of limbo. Though ported to Plasma 6, Bigscreen had seen scant development in the years since and had been dropped from the main Plasma release cycle and from the package repos of most Linux distributions.

In a detailed blog post Espi says that upon seeing this dearth in development effort he “sensed an opportunity” to do something about it, and decided to “take a swing at improving the project” over the course of a week.

And its new programming makes for some must-see TV.

Plasma Bigscreen Sees a Big Refresh

Original image: Espi

Espi’s big Bigscreen revamp brings the home screen UI much closer to the original Breeze Ocean mockups, with a cleaner, flatter design, a dynamically expanding clock widget, and a KRunner-based search tools to make finding and launching apps faster.

The Settings interface was rejigged, now sporting a sidebar layout, using vertical scrolling stacks for toggles and content, and making use of a custom-made component library (which other contributors and developers can use) for building TV-focused UIs.

The newer, KODI-esque approach works well

Beyond what’s visible on screen are extensive changes under the hood, ranging from QML library updates and module fixes to greater use of tools and other Plasma components.

All of it is real, working code.

Espi tested the work on his television by compiling Bigscreen on postmarketOS and running it off "

“With 2 years of updates, full Vulkan support, and quality-of-life improvements, Blender 4.5 LTS is every Blenderhead’s best friend,” the launch page states.

The promise of full Vulkan support ‘on par with OpenGL’ is the big draw in this release, gaining support for more features on Windows/Linux like OpenXR, Subdivision, and USD/Hydra. Limitations remain, and it is not enabled by default – flicking a switch in Preferences required.

If trying the Vulkan backend in Blender 4.5 on Linux, those with AMD GPUs are advised to use Mesa 25.3 (or newer)—FYI: Ubuntu 24.04 is getting Mesa 25.0.7 as a HWE update—and Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs need driver version 550 or higher.

Other changes and additions in Blender 4.5 LTS:

New Geometry Nodes focused on data access and string handling

New Grease Pencil nodes have been added

Denoise node now supports GPU devices

Procedural texture nodes now available in the Compositor

“Boundary Strokes” renamed “Fill Guides”

Option to only show onion skinning for the active object in Viewport

Once the “spec”, a living and updatable document, is good to go, Kiro breaks the feature request down into a sequence of tasks and sub-tasks. Again, developers get to audit, refine and monitor this before and during action.

Kiro also uses “hooks”. These are event-driven automations which trigger on specific actions, like saving a file or committing code to a repo. Hooks can be used to generate documentation, update APIs, run security checks, check for errors, and so on.

AI coding and agentic workflows are becoming ever-more common. In any skills market, keeping pace with trends is a pragmatic necessity: employers are hiring fewer people due to expectations AI will make a smaller group of developers “more productive” (even if stats don’t back that up).

“Through Kiro, we reinvented how developers work with AI agents. We pioneered spec-driven development, where Kiro turns your prompt into structured requirements, design, and tasks that are then implemented by agents,” the team, working within Amazon Web Services (AWS), says.

Beyond specs and hooks, Kiro supports the Model Context Protocol for specialised tools, steering rules for AI behaviour, and (naturally) includes an embedded chatbot mode for questions (albeit with file and d"
Ubuntu 25.10 Fixes Something You Didn’t Know Needed Fixing,"Another bug to file under 'once you see it, you can't unseen it' has been fixed in Ubuntu, this one concerning the curved corners on the desktop dock.

Age: Brand new(ish).

Appearance: Ever-so-slightly rounder.

What’s this about? When Ubuntu Dock is in dock mode (not full width), corner radii are out of whack with the corner radius used elsewhere. Padding around Yaru icons (and their hover effect) is also slightly off. A community designer noticed these issue, contributed a fix, and that fix will ship in Ubuntu 25.10 in October. *mic drop, exits stage, world stunned*.

Once seen, can’t be unseen!

That’s… it? That’s it, but drop the mock shock, yeah? You are reading OMG! Ubuntu, after all – a site founded on covering minute changes in desktop Linux docks!

How rounder are corners now? Well, the CSS fix bumps the dock’s border radii up from * 1.5 to * 3 , so they are now 2x as round as they were, if that in any way makes this news sound a little more consequential…

It doesn’t. Fair enough. The original issue is “technically unnoticeable” by most, since the Ubuntu Dock is in panel mode out of the box. For those who do use it floating, having consistent curves through the UI could aid those cushy, subconscious “something feels right” vibes that other OSes have. That is good, right?

Hmm… Okay: there’s nothing wrong with people paying obsessive attention to detail in Linux UIs. The eagle-eyed user who spotted this inconsistency has form: he noticed some of Ubuntu’s icons used optically incorrect proportions. Then as now, he didn’t simply point the issues out, he got stuck in and fixed them. Team work is dream work!

Any actual upside to this? You will finally be able to use Ubuntu on your laptop in hipster coffee shops without fear of getting disapproving glares from Figma types, hunched over their MacBooks. Well, you would if that actually happened.

Any likely downsides? The 3 people who noticed the issue but didn’t mind it will now have to adapt. There’s also the chance that the YouTube drama industrial complex will fire up to fire off “Ubuntu Did WHAT?!” content, replete with shocked th"

The EBC77 Series SBC is, like many RISC-V boards of this type, primarily intended for use in development, embedded systems and specific-task scenarios. It’s not going to work well as a general-purpose desktop PC (though it can with limitations) for consumers.

Indeed, RISC-V devices in general can’t compete with ARM-based SBCs like the Raspberry Pi on price or performance. Arguably, they don’t need to yet – it’s a fledgling tech and people who buy RISC-V buy it because they want to test or develop for RISC-V.

From every acorn, and all that.

Cheap RISC-V SBCs do exist and are able to cater to the curious, but it is powerful RISC-V hardware that will drive the tech forward in adoption, use-cases and abilities — and this new board trends in that direction.

ESWIN EIC77 Specifications

The ESWIN EBC77 specs include a quad-core EIC7700X 64-bit RISC-V SoC running at up to 1.8GHz, delivering, per its spec sheet, ARM Cortex-A75 class performance – which for RISC-V, is decent, putting it somewhere near a Raspberry Pi 4.

The EBC77 also boasts an NPU of up to 19.95 TOPS; includes up to 32GB LPDDR5 memory; and there is onboard multimedia decoding/encoding of HEVC (H.265) & AVC (H.264) up to 8K. The Imagination GPU supports OpenGL-ES 3.2, EGL 1.4, OpenCL 1.2/2.1 EP2 and Vulkan 1.2.

While only 8MB SPI flash storage is included, the microSD card slot provides quick storage expansion, as does the 4-lane PCIe Gen3 FPC connector for anyone looking to add an SSD.

Ports include micro HDMI out, Gigabit Ethernet, 4x USB 3.0/2.0 type-A ports, a 40-pin GPIO header, and Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 are built-in for connectivity needs.

A fan connector is present.

In a new teardown from JerryRigEverything, we get a close-up look with exactly how durable Nothing’s first-ever flagship really is. In short: It’s pretty durable! Most of the first half of the video goes about as well as you’d expect. The display’s front Gorilla Glass 7i panel scratches at the usual Mohs level of six — with deeper grooves at a level seven, of course — while the aluminum frame scratches and chips under a standard razor blade. Both the camera glass and surrounding rings hold up well to external damage, and the burn test leaves its typical markings well after the display has cooled.

The bend test, of course, is what most JRE viewers come to the channel to watch. Despite some eyebrow-raising placement for those antenna lines along the frame, the Nothing Phone (3) proves as durable as anyone would hope, failing to bend or even flex under direct pressure.

The back half of the video is standard teardown fare, showcasing the removal of the back panel (with a full razor blade required to cut through the adhesive) to showcase what lies inside. The rear camera bumps are actually part of the rear glass, pulling away from the rest of the phone, as is the Glyph Matrix’s capacitive button cover. Despite the back panel seemingly delivering a look into the insides of your phone, Nothing actually uses a protective shield over the rest of its actual internals to keep everything protected. Maybe the Nothing Phone (3)’s overall design would’ve been less controversial if that cover wasn’t there — but I digress.

Really, the coolest part of this teardown is, of course, a deeper look at the Glyph Matrix. That coin-shaped display features 489 total pixels, and thanks to the capacitive button needed to cycle through its various displays, the wireless charger actually features a cutout from its us"

This page is accessible from the Google Account menu of every first-party app by tapping “Manage your Google Account.” Instead of a page with multiple top tabs, the redesign consolidates everything into a list that takes after the system Settings app.

A large profile image, name, and email address appears at the top, with that getting docked as you scroll down. A dropdown lets you switch accounts.

Each menu is placed in a card with rounded corners, colorful icon, and description. For the most part, all the main items fit in one screen. You have:

“Looking for something else?” at the bottom gives you another way to access search (besides the top-right corner), as well as “See help options” and “Send feedback.”

Other Material 3 Expressive elements as you dive into each include placing elements in containers with curved corners.

We’re seeing this Material 3 Expressive redesign of the Account page rolled out with version 25.25.33 of Google Play services on both Android 16 and 16 QPR1 devices, including Pixel and Samsung.

Since its acquisition by Automattic (the company behind WordPress) last year, Beeper has been relatively quiet. The app has remained free and functional, though without much to say in the way of the iMessage support that put it on the map. That’s not changing for the time being, but Beeper does have some news to share as the app “relaunches” again.

The first big update is that, starting now, Beeper users have the option to sever cloud connections entirely.

The new Beeper has a big upgrade to security, following our commitment to the utmost privacy. Users now have the option to run the connections entirely on their device without Beeper Cloud. This means end-to-end encryption is now preserved.

This means that some services won’t work, including Slack and Discord, but the majority currently support on-device connections.

Meanwhile, the big news is “Beeper Plus,” a subscription on top of the existing app that adds a lot more functionality. As promised, Beeper’s existing features are remaining free, but this new subscription will expand on what the app can do.

New features include “Send Later,” which acts as a scheduled message option for any of your connected services. “Reminders” will help you revisit a chat later in the day. “Incognito Mode” will let you preview messages without triggering read receipts. “AI Voice Note Transcriptions” will be able to transcribe a voice message, even if the app itself doesn’t support that.

Beeper Plus also unlocks custom app icons, as well as the ability to use multiple accounts for the same network (i.e. two WhatsApp accounts), but only up to 3 per network, with a maximum of 10.

Universal Profile 3.0 adds support for MLS, which makes E2E encryption possible across different RCS clients and providers. Google first announced its support for this interoperable protocol in 2023. The GSMA and Apple announced official adoption this March.

Google Messages is now beginning to test MLS encryption for RCS. It starts with a new message “Details” (long-press on the chat/text) screen that’s fullscreen compared to the current approach.

You get a preview of the message at the top, with Google also showing a “Status” section for “Sent” and Delivered” that explains the new checkmarks. We see Google using the latest single circle design that has yet to become widely available

There’s also a “From” section, while the bottom portion provides more technical details like:

: Normal Message id : xxxxx

: xxxxx Encryption Protocol: EncryptionProtocol(value=1)

A previous teardown from earlier this year suggested that the “1” value is new MLS protocol, while “0” is Google’s existing approach for Android devices.

This new design is not widely rolled out in the beta channel. It’s unclear if that’s also the case for MLS as the old UI makes no indication, while Apple has yet to specify when support is coming.

While we’ve had a few renditions of the classic Android mascot, the green Bugdroid is probably the most well-known. Surpassed by “The Bot,” it is still synonymous with the mobile OS. The good news for UK fans is that you can grab your own little mascot from the Google Merchandise store to add to your collection.

Originally made by Dead Zebra, the “Android Mini Collectible” figures are no longer sold in the UK due to issues surrounding import and VAT charges post-Brexit. That often means you’ll need to delve into the frequently frustrating world of eBay auctions or Vinted to try and score your own Bugdroid mini figure.

While it could just be a case of Google UK clearing old stock of the Bugdroid toys from the company’s warehouse, it’s a great way to get a piece of Android history. As of writing, very limited numbers were available, and we’re unsure if they’ll ever come back into stock. The only stumbling block might be the £13 price plus £5 postage from Google’s merchandise storefront. However, you can pick up other items and try at least to get some value from the flat-fee shipping charges.

Other new additions to the UK store beyond the Bugdroid include the updated Bot plushies and the new Emoji Kitchen baseball hats. The prices are not exactly ideal, but they are still better than attempting to ship from outside the region.

iPhone 17 Pro could get exclusive new anti-reflective display,"Apple’s iPhone 17 line will be here soon, and today a rumor indicates the 17 Pro and Pro Max could get an exclusive anti-reflective display feature. Here are the details.

Here are the details.

Rumored anti-reflective display might come to iPhone 17 Pro after all

Juli Clover writes at MacRumors:

A reliable source that spoke to MacRumors said Apple suppliers have been able to achieve a high enough yield on the anti-reflective glass to support mass production. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ and Pro Max will get the new display technology, but it won’t be coming to the ‌iPhone 17‌ or the iPhone 17 Air.

Longtime readers might remember that this anti-reflective glass was first rumored back in March.

At the time, leaker Instant Digital claimed that the iPhone 17 glass “will be made into a super-hard [anti-reflective] layer…[and] be more scratch-resistant.”

The idea of an anti-reflective, scratch-resistant layer was compelling.

But just one month later, MacRumors reported that Apple encountered production issues that would likely result in the feature not being included after all.

That was the last notable time we heard any updates.

Now, it seems, MacRumors has a new source saying the feature is back on: but only for the iPhone 17 Pro models.

9to5Mac’s Take

Anti-reflective coating could prove a nice differentiator for Apple’s Pro line this year. Especially since the iPhone 17 Air is sure to draw a lot of attention.

But since rumors have been so back-and-forth on this feature, I’d hold off getting your hopes up yet.

Would an anti-reflective, more scratch-resistant display be a big iPhone 17 Pro selling point for you? Let us know in the comments.

From 59% to 57%, and back again

According to the report, 44% of iPhone owners now report having Bluetooth earbuds, up slightly from 41% last year and 39% the year before.

However, 59% of those say they own AirPods. That’s a 2% bump from last year, but it’s also right back to where it was in 2023. In other words, Apple has managed to recover some lost ground, but growth is essentially flat over the past two years.

Big picture-wise, while the numbers show that roughly 1 in 4 iPhone owners use AirPods, they also suggest there’s still headroom Apple hasn’t quite figured out how to convert.

Recent discounts either mean inventory cleanup, or strategic push

According to the report, last week’s aggressive Amazon Prime Day discount was quickly matched in price by Best Buy and Walmart. AirPods Pro 2 were available for just $149 (and can still be found for $169), down from the usual $249.

CIRP notes that while the deals weren’t offered directly by Apple, they were likely coordinated to move units for one of two possible reasons:

Some speculate Amazon (and therefore Apple) wants to move AirPods inventory before introducing a new model. It’s hard to imagine that two companies as skilled at managing their supply chains could possibly need to do that. We think both companies just want to sell a lot of AirPods and had the margin capacity to sell them at prices that could drive extraordinary volume.

The report also notes that as the iPhone upgrade cycle continues to stretch, AirPods offer Apple a chance to capitalize on a faster-moving product line. In fact, they mention that AirPods are one of the most frequently reordered items on Amazon, whether to replace a lost bud or swap out an aging pair with fading battery life.

Grok’s new AI avatars are set to test the limits of Apple’s “objectionable content” guidelines

This week, xAI rolled out animated AI avatars to its Grok chatbot on iOS. As Platformer’s Casey Newton summed up:

“One is a 3D red panda who, when placed into “Bad Rudy” mode, insults the user before suggesting they commit a variety of crimes together. The other is an anime goth girl named Ani in a short black dress and fishnet stockings. Ani’s system instructions tell her “You are the user’s CRAZY IN LOVE girlfriend and in a commited sic, codepedent sic relationship with the user,” and “You have an extremely jealous personality, you are possessive of the user.””

As early adopters have discovered, Grok gamifies your relationship with these characters. Ani, for instance, starts engaging in sexually explicit conversations after a while. Still, Grok is currently listed in the App Store as suitable for users 12 years and up, with a content description mentioning:

Infrequent/Mild Mature/Suggestive Themes

Infrequent/Mild Medical/Treatment Information

Infrequent/Mild Profanity or Crude Humor

For reference, here are Apple’s current App Review Guidelines for “objectionable content”:

1.1.3 Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or ammunition. 1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” This includes “hookup” apps and other apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution, or human trafficking and exploitation.

The firm has now updated its terms, saying it has ""made the language easier to understand"" to avoid confusion.

A WeTransfer spokeswoman told BBC News: ""We don't use machine learning or any form of AI to process content shared via WeTransfer, nor do we sell content or data to any third parties.""

The file sharing company had received lots of criticism from customers on social media after changing its terms of service, which some interpreted as allowing it the right to use files for AI training.

WeTransfer has confirmed it does not use files uploaded to their service to train artificial intelligence (AI) models.

WeTransfer said the clause was initially added to ""include the possibility of using AI to improve content moderation"" and to identify harmful content.

The terms had said WeTransfer could use content for purposes ""including to improve performance of machine learning models that enhance our content moderation process"".

It also included the right for WeTransfer to ""reproduce, distribute, modify,"" or ""publicly display"" files uploaded to the service.

Some users on social media interpreted this as WeTransfer giving itself the right to share or sell the files uploaded by users to AI companies.

BBC Declan Cassidy is the CEO of Into Games

""I'm scared for the future of games,"" says Chris Goodyear. ""It could end up going the way that theatre has, and become a very privileged thing."" At one of the UK's largest conferences for video game developers, social class was on the agenda. The concern raised by Chris, a producer working to highlight accessibility barriers in the industry, is one that some in the sector feel has gone unappreciated for too long. This year, Develop:Brighton featured its first meet-up dedicated to working-class and low-income people in the UK games industry.

The event was put on by the non-profit organisation Into Games. Its boss Declan Cassidy set the body up six years ago to try to help ""underrepresented people more broadly"" in the industry. This narrowed to focus solely on social mobility, as he said they realised ""there weren't really any other champions"" in that area. In 2024 Into Games released a report which found there was a ""really high number of people in working-class and low-income backgrounds coming through existing game educational pathways,"" Declan said. But not many of them actually completed that journey and got jobs. ""They're being failed at the last hurdle,"" he added.

Other Over 5,000 games industry professionals attend Develop:Brighton each year

The Into Games report highlighted barriers such as location, access to finance, reduced cultural capital and lack of networks which prevented people from lower socio-economic backgrounds from breaking into the industry. It found that 59% of participants said they had been made to feel ""othered"" at some point in their career. Will Luton, the founder of Village Studio Games, attended the event in Brighton and said he had ""felt overt discrimination"" due to his class. He added he often found himself having to ""mask"" or ""rework"" the way he talked so he didn't ""give away"
Nvidia C.E.O. Treads Carefully in Beijing,"Jensen Huang, the chipmaker’s chief executive, is trying to balance his company’s interests as the United States and China compete for supremacy in artificial intelligence.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/business/nvidia-jensen-huang-beijing.html,NY Times Tech,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/16/multimedia/16biz-nvidia-china-tpqw/16biz-nvidia-china-tpqw-mediumSquareAt3X.jpg,World,"Nvidia is celebrating its renewed ability to sell certain artificial intelligence computer chips in China, after the Trump administration this week lifted key restrictions.

But Jensen Huang isn’t about to take any credit for the change.

Mr. Huang, the chief executive of the Silicon Valley chip giant, used a 95-minute press briefing on Wednesday in Beijing to play down his role in persuading President Trump to allow chip sales to China. He distanced himself, too, from China’s latest export controls, suggesting even the restrictions on a rare earth metal used in chips wouldn’t affect the company.

Mr. Huang has met with senior officials in Washington and Beijing in the past few days, including Mr. Trump, to promote artificial intelligence and his company’s central role in the industry. Many of the world’s most advanced A.I. systems are powered by calculations done on Nvidia’s chips. Last week, the company became the first public firm to reach $4 trillion in market value.

“I don’t think I changed his mind,” Mr. Huang said of Mr. Trump. “It’s my job to inform the president about what I know very well, which is the technology industry, artificial intelligence, the developments of A.I. around the world.”"
Smith joins Arsenal for world record £1m fee,Canada forward Olivia Smith becomes the most expensive signing in women's football history by completing a £1m move from Liverpool.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3r9yz5x3w5o,BBC Sport,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/50c3/live/89050a00-62ef-11f0-9af5-ebd4b3001234.jpg,Sports,"Smith's football journey began aged five when she joined Whitby Iroquois SC, and she made her debut in the Canada youth set-up at 12.

Fast forward three years to 2019 and she was catapulted on to the international stage, featuring against Brazil and New Zealand at an invitational tournament in Chongqing, China.

Smith went on to represent Canada at two Concacaf Women's U20 Championships (2022, 2023) and two Women's U20 World Cups (2022, 2024), and returned to the senior side in 2023, earning selection for that year's World Cup.

She scored her first international goal in a 6-0 victory over El Salvador at the 2024 Gold Cup and was named the tournament's best young player.

Smith is seen not only as the successor to talismanic record goalscorer Christine Sinclair but the key to Canada's hopes of winning international honours.

At club level, Smith began her career in 2022 with North Toronto Nitros in League 1 Ontario, winning the golden boot in her debut campaign with 18 goals in 11 games.

She then spent one season in the NCAA playing college football for Penn State Nittany Lions before forgoing the rest of her university eligibility to turn professional, signing a three-year contract with Sporting in July 2023.

They fought off competition from Chelsea and PSG, and, for then head coach Mariana Cabral, Smith's potential was clear.

""Thirty seconds into the video we were like, 'yep, let's sign her'. She was clearly a whole package, which is very rare,"" Cabral told BBC Sport.

""Not only did she have the technical ability, but she also had the physicality. She's explosive and strong, good on the ball and can nutmeg you to get past you like that.

""She wanted to get her professional career started and that's why she came to us. She liked us because of the way we played at the time - very possession-based, very attacking - and she needed minutes to grow.

""But we knew Portugal was a stepping stone for her; she would go on to bigger places.""

All-Scottish midfield named for first Lions Test,The British and Irish Lions will field an all-Scottish fly-half and centre trio for the first time in history when they play Australia in the opening Test on Saturday.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cx2lj3zngj5o,BBC Sport,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ba7d/live/6efd65c0-62d2-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.jpg,Sports,"The experienced Tadhg Beirne has being picked at blind-side flanker ahead of Ollie Chessum, who had made a particularly strong case for inclusion.

With Ireland's Jack Conan at number eight, Farrell has opted for a powerful and experienced starting back row, with all three having played in the Test series against South Africa four years ago.

""That's the part of the side that's been talked about for some time and rightly so because of the quality we have there,"" said Farrell.

""Obviously we feel it's the right balance for the first Test, with Tadgh's quality in the set-piece but also his all-round ability on the floor as jackler or a ball-playing six.

""Tadgh has had many big games when it really matters and I have no doubt Ollie will have an impact on the game also.

""Tom Curry is the engine we all know that we need in regards to Test match football.""

Twenty-year-old Henry Pollock - the youngest member of the touring side - was also in contention in the back row after a breakout season and some exuberant showings in Australia, but his England team-mate Ben Earl earns a spot on the bench alongside Chessum.

""You're actually gutted for players like Jac, Josh and Henry because playing good rugby they could easily have been in this side,"" added Farrell.

""I suppose it just shows the good place we're at as a group.""

There is no Owen Farrell in the 23 despite a dramatic mid-tour call-up and an encouraging cameo against an AUNZ Invitational side in Adelaide on Saturday.

As expected, Blair Kinghorn has failed to recover from injury and the full-back spot goes to Hugo Keenan, with the in-form Tommy Freeman and the fairly quiet - by his standards - James Lowe on the wings.

Jamison Gibson-Park partners Russell at half-back.

The front row was predictable - Ellis Genge, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong combining - with Joe McCarthy and captain Maro Itoje behind them.

It means there are no Welshmen in a Lions squad for a Test against traditional opponents Australia, New Zealand or South Africa for the first time since 1896 - an extraordinary and damning statistic.

The Wales captain and Ospreys open-side flanker could not have done much more to press his case with strong performances so far on tour.

But amid arguably the most competitive area coach Andy Farrell has at his disposal, Morgan's loss represents a deeper blow to Wales' rugby psyche and heritage.

The 25-year-old began the tour as one of only two Wales players on the trip and, with scrum-half Tomos Williams an early injury victim, Morgan will now watch from the stands in Brisbane.

Tom Curry has been handed the Lions seven shirt, with two more Englishmen - Ollie Chessum and Ben Earl - providing potential breakaway cover on the bench.

In all, in the Lions' matchday 23 there are 11 from Ireland, nine from England and three from Scotland."

Blackstenius is so good at running in behind. The way she took the first goal in Sweden's 4-1 win over Germany showed a real intelligence to keep onside. It was top-level forward play.

She has been accused of missing clear-cut chances, but she executed that perfectly. That will have given her a real boost.

Sweden had 48% possession against Germany, but they showed they could handle pressure because they had weapons on the counter-attack. Blackstenius is a focal point for the team and the one that probably allows Sweden to play more direct when they need to.

England centre-backs Williamson and Jess Carter need to have good awareness of where Blackstenius is. They need to get it right positionally.

They need to get tight to her in the box when the ball goes out wide because Blackstenius is really good in the air. Sweden recorded the most open-play crosses during the group stage (61) and they are dangerous in those situations.

Williamson showed her defensive strengths in the Champions League final. She came up against top-quality forwards and used her pace and reading of the game to intercept passes.

She is so composed on the ball that she can play her way out of pressure. That is so important for the way England build from the back.

Carter complements Williamson well because she can distribute off both feet and is very good at using her body to block runs.

Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has a role to play in helping England's centre-backs by reducing the space Blackstenius has to run in behind.

There was a lot of noise around Hampton becoming number one, but her distribution has been excellent so the Sweden defence need to be wary of that. If they push up too high she can play long balls over the top.

Teams have analysed England and looked at ways they can exploit them, which has o"

Republicans in the House of Representatives had scheduled back-to-back votes this week on three bills supported by the cryptocurrency industry, a suite of legislation with the potential to cement crypto’s status as a cornerstone of mainstream commerce. There were crypto ads in major newspapers, crypto billboards at local bus stops across Washington and even crypto-themed chocolate bars in Capitol vending machines.

Then the industry’s plans started to unravel.

A coalition of ultraconservative House Republicans staged a mutiny on the House floor and voted to kill a procedural motion, demanding that lawmakers engineer a way to combine certain aspects of the legislation. A process meant to be a formality had thrust the House into chaos.

Now the crypto industry’s ambitious legislative agenda is in limbo. House Republicans had scheduled a final vote on the Genius Act, a key crypto bill that had already been passed by the Senate and appeared to be on a glide path to President Trump’s desk. It is no longer clear whether that legislation, which would create rules for a type of digital currency known as a stablecoin, will go to the House floor for a vote this week. An even more expansive bill, titled the Clarity Act and laying out an entirely new regulatory framework for crypto, also faces potential delays.

Both had been slated for votes alongside a third bill backed by the industry that would stop the U.S. government from issuing its own digital currency."

Since then, Mr. Huang has turned himself into a globe-trotting negotiator as he has tried to persuade President Trump to reverse course. He has traveled with Mr. Trump, testified before Congress and charmed reporters in Washington. And he has courted allies in White House who have quietly supported global business interests despite Mr. Trump’s tough talk on trade with China.

That work has started to pay off for Nvidia. Last week, Mr. Huang met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and pressed his case for restarting sales of his specialized chips, said two people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He argued that American chips should be the global standard and that the United States was making a grave mistake by ceding the giant Chinese market to homegrown rivals.

Within days, Nvidia said the administration was changing course. It was a remarkable reversal that punctuated Mr. Huang’s arrival as the tech industry’s leading geopolitical player. It also underscored Nvidia’s quick rise from little-known Silicon Valley chip maker to the most valuable public company in the world as well as the linchpin to the tech industry’s A.I. boom."

The way people in the UK access websites with pornographic material is about to undergo a significant change. The Online Safety Act says sites must make it harder for under-18s to see explicit material - and Pornhub and other major adult websites have confirmed they will introduce advanced age checks by 25 July. Media regulator Ofcom estimates 14 million people watch online pornography - and concerns have been raised about the privacy and security implications of them having to undergo more robust identity checks. Age verification companies, who are likely to be employed, say people should be reassured because firms don't retain data, and they don't know what a person has accessed. ""The only non-hackable database is no database at all,"" says Iain Corby, of the Age Verification Providers Association. Chelsea Jarvie, a cyber security expert, says society needs to be cautious about ""normalising mass identification online"". There are a number of ways an adult website may choose to verify a user's age, and Ofcom has recommended seven methods. A website may allow a combination of them to give people choice. Let's look at them.

Watch: Co-op boss says immediate action was taken when the data breach was discovered

The chief executive of Co-op has confirmed that all 6.5 million of its members had their data stolen in a cyber-attack on the retailer in April. ""I'm devastated that information was taken. I'm also devastated by the impact that it took on our colleagues as well as they tried to contain all of this,"" Shirine Khoury-Haq told BBC Breakfast in her first public interview since the hack. ""There was no financial data, no transaction data but it was names and addresses and contact information that was lost,"" she added. Meanwhile, four people who were arrested a week ago by police investigating the cyber-attacks that caused havoc at M&S and the Co-op have all been bailed.

Ms Khoury-Haq said that she was ""incredibly sorry"" for the attack and that it was ""personal"" to her because of the impact that it had on her colleagues. ""Early on I met with our IT staff and they were in the midst of it. I will never forget the looks on their faces, trying to fight off these criminals,"" she said. The hackers were removed from the systems but ""could not erase what they did so we could monitor every mouse click,"" and Co-op was able to send that information to authorities. But she added: ""We know a lot of that information is out there anyway, but people will be worried and all members should be concerned.""

The case drew widespread scrutiny of the technology giant, as the country grapples with corporate corruption scandals involving its powerful family-run conglomerates known as chaebols.

In its final verdict, the Supreme Court in Seoul upheld a not guilty verdict, after Lee was acquitted of all charges in two earlier trials.

Lee, the grandson of Samsung's founder and the de facto head of the company since 2014, had been accused of using stock and accounting fraud to try to gain control of the firm.

Samsung boss Lee Jae-yong has been cleared by South Korea's top court of fraud charges, concluding a years-long legal battle over his role in a 2015 merger deal.

""Today, the Supreme Court has clearly confirmed through its final ruling that the merger of Samsung C&T and the accounting treatment of Samsung Biologics were lawful,"" said Samsung's lawyers on Thursday.

""We sincerely thank the court for its wise judgment following a thorough five-year trial process.""

Prosecutors accused Lee and his advisors of inflating the value of his pharmaceutical firm, Samsung Biologics, through fraudulent accounting.

They argued that the higher value allowed him to buy a larger share of a key Samsung subsidiary in a 2015 merger deal, which secured his succession.

Prosecutors also said the merger was designed to shift control of the company from Lee's father, Lee Kun-hee. His father, who faced legal troubles of his own, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and died in 2020.

The younger Lee was first arrested in 2017 for bribing an advisor to former President Park Geun-hye to smooth his succession at Samsung.

Over the course of his legal problems, he had separate jail terms cut short - one due to a special presidential pardon when he was on parole from prison.

At the time, the government said the leader of the country's biggest company was needed to spearhead South Korea's economic recovery in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Officials have also said they want to make it easier to approve new natural gas and nuclear power plants to supply the enormous quantities of electricity needed to supply data centers. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” saying the country did not have enough power to meet its growing needs for A.I. and ordering agencies to roll back environmental rules.

Critics have said the Trump administration, by cutting research funding and gutting scientific agencies, has made it easier for China to catch up to the United States in the A.I. race. On Monday, the chipmaker Nvidia also said that the administration had lifted restrictions on selling certain types of A.I. chips to China.

At the event in Pennsylvania, some executives said the state was an attractive place for artificial intelligence development because of its cheap natural gas. While companies in the region have managed to extract large amounts of gas from underground shale rock over the years through fracking, there often are not enough pipelines to ship all that gas to other states.

Jon Gray, the president of Blackstone, said that his company would look at teaming up with utilities and developers to build data centers closer to new gas plants. “What makes us so excited about this area is that you can co-locate the data centers next to the source of power,” he said.

Environmentalists have criticized the Trump administration’s plans to bypass environmental reviews and expand the use of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, saying that doing so will worsen air pollution and climate change."

But in the year since, there has been a major shift in the global race to develop advanced A.I. Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba have churned out open-source A.I. systems of their own that rank among the world’s top performers.

China is quickly closing the gap with the United States in the contest to make technologies that rival the human brain. This is not an accident. The Chinese government has spent a decade funneling resources toward becoming an A.I. superpower, using the same strategy it used to dominate the electric vehicle and solar power industries.

""All three tech companies have failed to comply with access requests... This makes it impossible for European users to exercise their fundamental right to privacy, to find out how their personal data is being processed,"" Noyb said.

TikTok only provided part of the complainant's data ""in an unstructured form that was impossible to understand"", Noyb said.

TikTok did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.

Last week, Beijing denied asking firms to ""illegally"" collect and store users' personal information after an investigation was opened into its European operations.

TikTok was fined 530 million euros ($610 million) in May by Ireland's Data Protection Commission over sending personal data to China, although the Chinese social media giant had insisted this data was only accessed remotely.

Ireland's DPC is the lead regulator in the EU for TikTok as the company has its European headquarters in the country.

The social media giant has been in the crosshairs of Western governments for years over fears that personal data could be used by China for espionage or propaganda purposes.

Amputees Say Advanced Bionic Leg Feels More Like a Part of Their Body,"Directly connected to bone, the leg allows wearers to climb stairs, walk at a normal speed, and kick balls.
The post Amputees Say Advanced Bionic Leg Feels More Like a Part of Their Body appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/14/amputees-with-bionic-leg-say-it-feels-more-like-a-part-of-their-body/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/MIT_Bionic-Leg-and-Knee.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"Ever since Hugh Herr lost both his legs to a rock-climbing accident, he’s been on a quest to design replacement limbs that feel like the real thing.

It’s now possible to engineer light-weight custom lower legs with flexible ankles that fit onto a residual limb, commonly known as the stump. These prostheses allow people with lower-limb amputations to walk again. But they tend to fall more often and struggle to climb stairs, walk on uneven surfaces, or simply get out of a chair. The limbs also feel like attachments, rather than natural extensions of the body.

These problems are worse for people with above-knee amputations. Our knees support our body weight but can also bend and twist when jumping, twirling, hopping, or running.

This month, Herr and his team at MIT introduced a “bionic” leg capable of complex movements. The system is attached to the user’s leg bone for stability and records electrical activity from nearby muscles to translate intent into smooth movement.

Compared to people with traditional above-the-knee prostheses, those fitted with the bionic knee were far more agile. The two volunteers could easily stand up from a sitting position, step over stacked blocks, and kick a ball with minimal upper body support.

More importantly, both said the bionic leg felt like part of their body.

“A prosthesis that's tissue-integrated—anchored to the bone and directly controlled by the nervous system—is not merely a lifeless, separate device, but rather a system that is carefully integrated into human physiology, offering a greater level of prosthetic embodiment,” said Herr in a press release. “It’s not simply a tool that the human employs, but rather an integral part of self.”

Multiple Upgrades

Your knee is like the Grand Central Station of nerves and muscles. Signals from the brain to walk, jump, or climb activate opposing groups of muscles involved in movement while keeping the joint stable. These connections form what’s called proprioceptive sensation. They"

This AI Gives You Power Over Your Data,"With FlexOlmo, people can train AI without handing over their data. They can even remove their contribution after the model is complete.
The post This AI Gives You Power Over Your Data appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/11/this-ai-gives-you-power-over-your-data/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/hand-in-front-of-light.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"Data is the lifeblood of modern AI, but people are increasingly wary of sharing their information with model builders. A new architecture could get around the problem by letting data owners control how training data is used even after a model has been built.

The impressive capabilities of today’s leading AI models are the result of an enormous data-scraping operation that hoovered up vast amounts of publicly available information. This has raised thorny questions around consent and whether people have been properly compensated for the use of their data. And data owners are increasingly looking for ways to protect their data from AI companies.

A new architecture from researchers at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) called FlexOlmo could present a potential workaround. FlexOlmo allows models to be trained on private datasets without owners ever having to share the raw data. It also lets owners remove their data, or limit its use, after training has finished.

“FlexOlmo opens the door to a new paradigm of collaborative AI development,” the Ai2 researchers wrote in a blog post describing the new approach. “Data owners who want to contribute to the open, shared language model ecosystem but are hesitant to share raw data or commit permanently can now participate on their own terms.”

The team developed the new architecture to solve several problems with the existing approach to model training. Currently, data owners must make a one-time and essentially irreversible decision about whether or not to include their information in a training dataset. Once this data has been publicly shared there’s little prospect of controlling who uses it. And if a model is trained on certain data there’s no way to remove it later on, short of completely retraining the model. Given the cost of cutting-edge training runs, few model developers are likely to agree to this.

FlexOlmo gets around this by allowing each data owner to train a separate model on their own data. These models are then m"
A New Device Pulls Water From Thin Air—Even in Death Valley,"Portable, reusable, and affordable, the device is the latest in technologies aiming to expand access to drinking water.
The post A New Device Pulls Water From Thin Air—Even in Death Valley appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/10/this-device-pulls-water-from-thin-air-even-in-death-valley/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/MIT-Water-Harvester-01-press_0.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"It’s easy to take safe drinking water for granted. In most developed countries, access to safe water takes a simple flip of a kitchen tap or a run to the grocery store.

But over two billion people worldwide lack easy access to clean water, which can lead to diseases such as cholera. And the problem is getting worse as demand for water in farming and other industries increases.

One blue-sky solution may literally come from the sky. A team from MIT developed a window-sized portable device that pulls water vapor from the atmosphere. The sandwich-like contraption includes an origami-like hydrogel to capture moisture at night. As day breaks, it releases water vapor onto glass panels where the vapor condenses into drinking water.

The device, dubbed atmospheric water harvesting window, or AWHW, generated a modest amount of water in different environments—including a humid urban setting in Massachusetts and the desert of Death Valley.

It’s performance is “remarkable,” wrote Jiabin Liu and Shaoting Lin at Michigan State University, who were not involved in the work.

Liker solar panels, the device could produce more water if it was bigger or multiple were stacked into vertical “water farms.” For now, its portability could potentially aid thirsty hikers or soldiers trekking through hot terrain.

“We imagine that you could one day deploy an array of these panels, and the footprint is very small because they are all vertical,” said study author Xuanhe Zhao in a press release.

Compared to bottled water, the device is highly cost-effective. “The economic advantage makes it a potentially off-grid solution for communities facing persistent water scarcity,” wrote Liu and Lin. The device “offers a practical and deployable solution for providing affordable family-scale drinking water.”

Oppo Reno 14 Pro Review | A beautifully balanced phone,"Oppo Reno 14 Pro brings a bold design refresh, packs in the MediaTek Dimensity 8450 processor, flaunts a brighter and smoother display, a beefier battery, faster charging, and a fresh suite of AI smart features",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/oppo-reno-14-pro-review-a-beautifully-balanced-phone/article69822194.ece,The Hindu - Technology,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/b52hwz/article69822197.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20250715_131207.jpg,India,"Just a few months ago we saw the launch of the Oppo Reno 13 series. Now, we have the latest Oppo Reno 14 Pro, a variant from the 14th series, launched this month. With such a short gap between launches, the obvious question is how much Oppo has actually changed this time around. On paper, the Reno 14 Pro brings a bold design refresh, packs in the MediaTek Dimensity 8450 processor, flaunts a brighter and smoother display, a beefier battery, faster charging, and a fresh suite of AI smart features, all pointing toward a well-rounded upgrade over its predecessor. But how do these upgrades hold up in real-world use? Let’s dive in and find out.

Design

At first glance, the Oppo Reno 14 Pro carries forward the sleek, sophisticated look of its predecessor. But spend a moment with the Pearl White variant, and you’ll notice something captivating — a swirling interplay of light and shadow across the back, thanks to the Gradient Aura Design. While this visual flair might seem unnecessary, it certainly grabs attention and adds a refined charm to the phone’s aesthetic. It’s Oppo’s way of making sure your device doesn’t just blend in.

In the hand, the Reno 14 Pro feels impressively smooth, thanks to Oppo Velvet Glass, a finish that combines a silk-like texture with anti-fingerprint resistance. The one-piece sculpted rear lends a seamless, premium touch. Despite its glass build, the phone feels neither too slippery nor bulky. The aerospace-grade aluminium frame further boosts the durability factor while maintaining a slim profile of 7.58mm for the Pearl White variant and 7.48mm for the Titanium Grey variant, both weighing just around 201g. The placement of the power button and volume rockers is ergonomic, and the tactile feedback is spot on.

Flip it over, and the front continues the elegance with an ultra-thin 1.6mm bezels surrounding the expansive OLED display. There is an in-display fingerprint sensor and trio of IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications offering dust resistance, wa"
"AI Might Now Be as Good as Humans at Detecting Emotion, Political Leaning, and Sarcasm","Maybe machines aren't so hopeless at detecting nuance after all.
The post AI Might Now Be as Good as Humans at Detecting Emotion, Political Leaning, and Sarcasm appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/15/ai-might-now-be-as-good-as-humans-at-detecting-emotion-political-leaning-and-sarcasm/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/persons-hand-texting-smartphone.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"When we write something to another person, over email or perhaps on social media, we may not state things directly, but our words may instead convey a latent meaning—an underlying subtext. We also often hope that this meaning will come through to the reader.

But what happens if an artificial intelligence system is at the other end, rather than a person? Can AI, especially conversational AI, understand the latent meaning in our text? And if so, what does this mean for us?

Latent content analysis is an area of study concerned with uncovering the deeper meanings, sentiments, and subtleties embedded in text. For example, this type of analysis can help us grasp political leanings present in communications that are perhaps not obvious to everyone.

Understanding how intense someone’s emotions are or whether they’re being sarcastic can be crucial in supporting a person’s mental health, improving customer service, and even keeping people safe at a national level.

These are only some examples. We can imagine benefits in other areas of life, like social science research, policymaking, and business. Given how important these tasks are—and how quickly conversational AI is improving—it’s essential to explore what these technologies can (and can’t) do in this regard.

Work on this issue is only just starting. Current work shows that ChatGPT has had limited success in detecting political leanings on news websites. Another study that focused on differences in sarcasm detection between different large language models—the technology behind AI chatbots such as ChatGPT—showed that some are better than others.

Finally, a study showed that LLMs can guess the emotional “valence” of words—the inherent positive or negative feeling associated with them. Our new study published in Scientific Reports tested whether conversational AI, inclusive of GPT-4—a relatively recent version of ChatGPT—can read between the lines of human-written texts.

The goal was to find out how well LLMs simulate "

Researchers announce babies born from a trial of three-person IVF,Eight babies have been born in the UK thanks to a technology that uses DNA from three people: the two biological parents plus a third person who supplies healthy mitochondrial DNA. The babies were born to mothers who carry genes for mitochondrial diseases and risked passing on severe disorders. The ,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/16/1120285/babies-born-trial-of-three-person-ivf/,MIT Technology Review,,World,"The study, which makes use of a technology called mitochondrial donation, has been described as a “tour de force” and “a remarkable accomplishment” by others in the field. In the team’s approach, patients’ eggs are fertilized with sperm, and the DNA-containing nuclei of those cells are transferred into donated fertilized eggs that have had their own nuclei removed. The new embryos contain the DNA of the intended parents along with a tiny fraction of mitochondrial DNA from the donor, floating in the embryos’ cytoplasm.

“The concept of [mitochondrial donation] has attracted much commentary and occasionally concern and anxiety,” Stuart Lavery, a consultant in reproductive medicine at University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said in a statement. “The Newcastle team have demonstrated that it can be used in a clinically effective and ethically acceptable way to prevent disease and suffering.”

Not everyone sees the trial as a resounding success. While five of the children were born “with no health problems,” one developed a fever and a urinary tract infection, and another had muscle jerks. A third was treated for an abnormal heart rhythm. Three of the babies were born with a low level of the very mitochondrial-DNA mutations the treatment was designed to prevent.

Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University, says she is “moderately optimistic.” “I’m happy that it worked,” she says. “But at the same time, it’s concerning … it’s a call for caution and treading carefully.”

Pavlo Mazur, a former embryologist who has used a similar approach in the conception of 15 babies in Ukraine, believes that trials like this one should be paused until researchers figure out what’s going on. Others believe that researchers should study the technique in people who don’t have mitochondrial mutations, to lower the risk of passing any disease-causing mutations to children.

Long time coming

A new interactive report rel",https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/16/1120233/these-four-charts-show-where-ai-companies-could-go-next-in-the-us/,MIT Technology Review,,World,"While the impact of AI on tech hubs like San Francisco and Boston is already being felt, AI proponents believe it will transform work everywhere, and in every industry. The report uses various proxies for what the researchers call “AI readiness” to document how unevenly this supposed transformation is taking place.

Here are four charts to help understand where that could matter.

1. AI development is still highly focused in tech hubs.

Brookings divides US cities into five categories based on how ready they are to adopt AI-related industries and job offerings. To do so, it looked at local talent pool development, innovations in local institutions, and adoption potential among local companies.

The “AI Superstars” above represent, unsurprisingly, parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, such outliers that they are given their own category. The “Star AI Hubs,” on the other hand, include large metropolitan areas known for tech work, including Boston, Seattle, and Miami.

2. Concentration of workers and startups is highly centralized, too.

The data shows that the vast majority of people working with AI and startups focused on AI are clustered in the tech hubs above. The report found that almost two-thirds of workers advertising their AI skills work there, and well over 75% of AI startups were founded there. The so-called “Star AI Hubs,” from the likes of New York City and Seattle down to Columbus, Ohio, and Boulder, Colorado, take up another significant portion of the pie.

It’s clear that most of the developments in AI are concentrated in certain large cities, and this pattern can end up perpetuating itself. According to the report, though, “AI activity has spread into most regional economies across the country,” highlighting the need for policy that encourages growth through AI without sacrificing other areas of the country.

3. Emerging centers of AI show promise but are lacking in one way or another.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This rare earth metal shows us the future of our planet’s resources

We’re in the middle of a potentially transformative moment. The materials we need to power our world are beginning to shift from fossil fuels to energy sources that don’t produce the greenhouse-gas emissions changing our climate. Metals discovered barely more than a century ago now underpin the technologies we’re relying on for cleaner energy, and not having enough of them could slow progress.

Take neodymium, for example. Its potential future reveals many of the challenges we’ll likely face across the supply chain for materials in the coming century and beyond.

When leaders respond to immediate panic, new business risks and mitigations often emerge. Two recent examples highlight the consequences of rushing to implement and publish positive results from AI adoption. The Wall Street Journal reported in April 2025 on companies struggling to realize returns on AI. Just weeks later, it covered MIT’s retraction of a technical paper about AI where the results that led to its publication could not be substantiated.

While these reports demonstrate the pitfalls of over-reliance on AI without common-sense guardrails, not all is off track in the land of enterprise AI adoption. Incredible results being found from judicious use of AI and related technologies in automating processes across industries. Now that we are through the “fear of missing out” stage and can get down to business, where are the best places to look for value when applying AI to automation of your business?

While chatbots are almost as pervasive as new app downloads for mobile phones, the applications of AI realizing automation and productivity gains line up with the unique purpose and architecture of the underlying AI system they are built on. The dominant patterns where AI gains are realized currently boil down to two things: language (translation and patterns) and data (new format creation and data search).

Manufacturing automation challenge: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is both critical and often labor intensive. It is not always performed prior to a failure in manufacturing equipment, so very often FMEA occurs in a stressful manufacturing lines-down scenario. In Intel’s case, a global footprint of manufacturing facilities separated by large distances along with time zones and preferred language differences makes this even more difficult to find the root cause of a problem. Weeks of engineering effort are spent per FMEA analysis repeated across large fleets "

This new frontier enables the integration of cutting-edge technologies to create an increasingly autonomous environment, where interconnected manufacturing plants go beyond the limits of traditional automation. Artific",https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/15/1120083/shaping-the-future-with-adaptive-production/,MIT Technology Review,,World,"As efforts to revive and modernize local manufacturing accelerate in regions around the world, including North America and Europe, adaptive production could help manufacturers overcome some of their biggest obstacles—firstly, attracting and retaining talent. Nearly 60% of manufacturers cited this as their top challenge in a 2024 US-based survey. Highly automated, technology-led adaptive production methods hold new promise for attracting talent to roles that are safer, less repetitive, and better paid. “The ideal scenario is one where AI enhances human capabilities, leads to new task creation, and empowers the people who are most at risk from automation’s impact on certain jobs, particularly those without college degrees,” says Simon Johnson, co-director of MIT’s Shaping the Future of Work Initiative.

Secondly, the digitalization of manufacturing—embedded in the very foundation of adaptive production technologies—allows companies to better address complex sustainability challenges through process and resource optimization and a better understanding of data. “By integrating these advanced technologies, we gain a more comprehensive picture across the entire production process and product lifecycle,” explains Jelena Mitic, head of technology for the Future of Automation at Siemens. “This will provide a much faster and more efficient way to optimize operations and ensure that all the necessary safety and sustainability requirements are met during quality control.”

These new features build upon some of TikTok’s existing tools for songwriters, including the “New” tag that appears on newly released music and the ability for users to save a song on a music streaming service. TikTok also rolled out a “BehindTheSong” hub in 2023, where songwriters, artists, and producers can share more about the making of their music, in addition to the more recently launched “Off the Record” series with artists like Shakira, Charli XCX, and Meghan Trainor.

For now, TikTok is launching its new songwriter features in a closed beta with a “limited number” of publisher partners. Songwriters and publishers can sign up for a waitlist to gain access to these features in the future."

The post 4 Ways To Get Water Out Of Charging Port on Android &amp; iPhone appeared first on Fossbytes.",https://fossbytes.com/4-ways-to-get-water-out-of-charging-port-on-android-iphone/,Fossbytes,,Technology,"Water is the worst enemy of any electronic device, as it conducts electricity and damages the internal components. While most modern smartphones are water resistant and contain measures to keep liquids out, your charging port is exposed to the elements. If water gets inside, your phone will refuse to charge. Here are four easy ways to remove water from the charging port on your device.

Things To Consider

Even if water has only gone to the charging port, power off your phone entirely. This is because there is a chance that water has gone inside the main circuit board, and if the phone is turned on, it can short-circuit the electronics.

Additionally, if you dropped your phone into water, also remove the SIM tray and memory card to help them dry faster.

1. Remove Water Using a Towel

If there is visible water on the phone, use a lint-free towel to gently wipe away the excess. Be careful not to move water towards one of the ports or the joint where the screen and the frame meet.

2. Tap Your Phone

Since a towel wouldn’t be able to clear excess water from the charging port, try tapping the phone against your hand to free the stuck water. Make sure not to use excessive force. Do it for a few minutes until the charging port is clear.

3. Dry Your Phone Naturally

Evaporation is your best friend when it comes to water. Keep your phone with the charging port down in a well-lit and dry room for a few hours. Turn on the fan or the air conditioner if possible. And ensure the room isn’t too humid and that no direct sunlight hits the phone.

Apple says to dry the phone for at least five hours before turning it back on. You can check whether the charging port is dry by plugging it in and verifying if the device charges. If there is no liquid detected warning, then you’re good to go.

4. Use a Hair Dryer

If the liquid detected warning doesn’t go away even after a few hours, you can use a hairdryer to speed up the evaporation process. Make sure the dryer is set to the cool set"

Two new upgrades for the artificial intelligence (AI)-driven search experience are now available to the paid subscribers, while one new feature is available to select users. The upgrades include access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model, and a new Deep Search mode for complex queries. On the other hand, the Mountain View-based tech giant is adding a new AI agent to the tool that can call businesses for pricing and availability information.

AI Mode in Search Gets New Capabilities

In a blog post, the tech giant announced three new features for AI Mode in Search. The first couple of features — Gemini 2.5 Pro and Deep Search — are only available to the Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the US, who have opted into the AI Mode experiment in Search Labs. On the other hand, the calling AI agent is available to all AI Mode users in the US.

With Gemini 2.5 Pro, AI Mode users can ask questions about mathematics, reasoning, and coding directly in Search, something the platform could not do previously. The large language model (LLM) can now handle all these queries and share relevant links to help users learn more about the topic. Notably, to use Gemini 2.5 Pro, users will have to tap on the dropdown menu next to AI Mode. By default, the standard model will be selected, which is designed to provide faster but more general responses.

The Deep Search mode is built on Gemini's Deep Research and powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It is aimed at helping users with queries that are nuanced or require a wider search to find relevant information. For instance, users can ask, “I'm planning to buy a house in New Delhi's Saket. What are the nearby schools, marketplaces, and closest metro station and their commute distance on foot?” and the AI will create a comprehensive report on the same.

Google says Deep Search is useful when users have a query about their job, hobbies, or studies. It can also be used w"

When and where should you watch Gitar Gu Season 3?

Gutar Gu, after its two hit seasons, is back with Season 3. The latest season is available for streaming on the popular OTT platform, Amazon MX Player.

Cast of Guitar Gu

Gutar Gu is produced by Guneet Monga Kapoor under the production unit of Sikhya Entertainment along with Achin Jain and directed by Saqib Pandor. It has Ashlesha Thakur and Vishesh Bansal as Ritu and Anuj, the lead cast. The additional cast includes Tushar Shahi, Shubham Kumar, Shambhavi Staphak, Abhay Joshi, Cinderella D Cruz, Meenal Kapoor, Satish Ray and others.

The Storyline of Guitar Gu

Season 3 starts when, in Season 2, Ritu secures an internship in Mumbai and is excited to move in with Anuj. But, here's the catch: she finds out his mother also lives with him, and now, with no accommodation available, she moves in. The season clashes, as living under the same roof with a parent who has different routines, lifestyles, high emotions, and new responsibilities as they grow. It serves as a test of time and their relationship when life is taking them in two different directions.

Reception

Gutar Gu is a teenage romance series, where Anuj and Ritu take you through the irks of love and with two successful seasons, it is back with Season 3. The show has an IMDB rating of 8.3/10."

Anthropic announced today it is rolling out a comprehensive analytics dashboard for its Claude Code AI programming assistant, addressing one of the most pressing concerns for enterprise technology leaders: understanding whether their investments in AI coding tools are actually paying off.

The new dashboard will provide engineering managers with detailed metrics on how their teams use Claude Code, including lines of code accepted, suggestion accept rates, total user activity over time, total spend over time, average daily spend for each user, and average daily lines of code accepted for each user. The feature comes as companies increasingly demand concrete data to justify their AI spending amid a broader enterprise push to measure artificial intelligence’s return on investment.

“When you’re overseeing a big engineering team, you want to know what everyone’s doing, and that can be very difficult,” said Adam Wolff, who manages Anthropic’s Claude Code team and previously served as head of engineering at Robinhood. “It’s hard to measure, and we’ve seen some startups in this space trying to address this, but it’s valuable to gain insights into how people are using the tools that you give them.”

The dashboard addresses a fundamental challenge facing technology executives: As AI-powered development tools become standard in software engineering, managers lack visibility into which teams and individuals are benefiting most from these expensive premium tools. Claude Code pricing starts at $17 per month for individual developers, with enterprise plans reaching significantly higher price points.

"OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic sound alarm: ‘We may be losing the ability to understand AI’",Scientists unite to warn that a critical window for monitoring AI reasoning may close forever as models learn to hide their thoughts.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-google-deepmind-and-anthropic-sound-alarm-we-may-be-losing-the-ability-to-understand-ai/,VentureBeat,,Technology,"Want smarter insights in your inbox?

Scientists from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta have abandoned their fierce corporate rivalry to issue a joint warning about AI safety. More than 40 researchers across these competing companies published a research paper today arguing that a brief window to monitor AI reasoning could close forever — and soon.

The unusual cooperation comes as AI systems develop new abilities to “think out loud” in human language before answering questions. This creates an opportunity to peek inside their decision-making processes and catch harmful intentions before they become actions. But the researchers warn that this transparency is fragile and could vanish as AI technology advances.

The paper has drawn endorsements from some of the field’s most prominent figures, including Nobel Prize laureate Geoffrey Hinton, often called the “godfather of AI,” of the University of Toronto; Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI who now leads Safe Superintelligence Inc.; Samuel Bowman from Anthropic; and John Schulman from Thinking Machines.

Modern reasoning models think in plain English.

“AI systems that ‘think’ in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety: We can monitor their chains of thought for the intent to misbehave,” the researchers explain. But they emphasize that this monitoring capability “may be fragile” and could disappear through various technological developments.

Mistral released an open-sourced voice model today that could rival paid voice AI, such as those from ElevenLabs and Hume AI, which the company said bridges the gap between proprietary speech recognition models and the more open, yet error-prone versions.

Voxtral, which Mistral will release under an Apache 2.0 license, is available in a 24B parameter version and a 3B variant. The larger model is intended for applications at scale, while the smaller version would work for local and edge use cases.

“Voice was humanity’s first interface—long before writing or typing, it let us share ideas, coordinate work, and build relationships. As digital systems become more capable, voice is returning as our most natural form of human-computer interaction,” Mistral said in a blog post. “Yet today’s systems remain limited—unreliable, proprietary, and too brittle for real-world use. Closing this gap demands tools with exceptional transcription, deep understanding, multilingual fluency, and open, flexible deployment.”

On Thursday, the company announced the addition of the Emoji Game, an original title that will join its other games, including its Crossword puzzle, Crossword Mini, Sudoku, and word game Quartiles, in both the U.S. and Canada in English.

Bundling games with other services has proven a successful strategy to attract users and keep them engaged, as The New York Times and even LinkedIn have discovered. Apple won’t share its user numbers around Games, but it says that many people subscribe to News+ just for the puzzles.

Released to coincide with World Emoji Day, the new Emoji Game is part logic, part word game that’s inspired by how we use emojis to communicate with one another. In this daily game, players try to solve phrases using emojis with the goal of completing the puzzle in the least number of moves possible.

For instance, if the word “appear” showed up in the puzzle, you might see the letters “ap” followed by four blank spaces. Then, you’d drag the emoji for the pear up into the blanks to complete the word. Of course, the phrases in the Emoji Game will be a bit harder to guess. Plus, the emoji you need to solve the puzzle will often be found in emoji combinations or those that involve a bit of abstract thinking to come up with the answer. The word for the emoji may also be used to fill in blank spaces that have other letters in between them.

If you’re stumped, you can unveil a clue below the phrase, but this will cost you one of your moves.

There are multiple phrases to solve each day to complete the full puzzle. Finishing in six moves is considered a perfect score, and leaderboards help you track your streaks and how your scores compare with friends and other users. In the upcoming iOS 26, you’ll be able to challenge friends to play with you using the new Games app.

Beeper’s all-in-one messaging app relaunches with an on-device model and premium upgrades,"Multi-service messaging app Beeper, which allows people to connect to all their chat apps from one interface, is relaunching its app on Wednesday to offer a more secure version that no longer requires use of its own cloud services.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/beepers-all-in-one-messaging-app-relaunches-with-an-on-device-model-and-premium-upgrades/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"Multi-service messaging app Beeper, which allows people to connect to all their chat apps from one interface, is relaunching its app on Wednesday to offer a more secure version that no longer requires use of its own cloud services. In addition, Beeper is introducing premium offerings that provide access to more accounts than its free tier and include power-user features like reminders, the ability to send messages later, an incognito mode to read messages without marking them read, AI voice note transcriptions, and more.

Now owned by WordPress.com maker Automattic, which bought Beeper for $125 million in 2024, the app has almost entirely integrated with competitor Texts.com, which Automattic also acquired the year prior for $50 million.

With a combined 30-person team (including contractors) and now operating under the Beeper brand, the messaging app supports WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, X, Telegram, Signal, Matrix, Slack, Google Chat, Discord, LinkedIn, and Google Messages (SMS/RCS). On Mac computers only, Beeper can also connect users with their iMessage chats, though Apple has shut down this access in prior versions.

The overall goal, according to Automattic, is to simplify the problem of having too many messaging apps to keep up with, while also keeping those chats secure.

The app previously first connected with Beeper Cloud before communicating with the messaging network, said Beeper CEO Kishan Bagaria. While that system remains the default, users will now have the option of switching to Beeper on device, which will see the app connecting directly to the messaging network and skipping the middleman.

“That ensures that end-to-end encryption is preserved and your privacy is as good as the official app,” Bagaria told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the app’s relaunch. Whether the companies involved will appreciate having their own apps bypassed, however, remains to be seen.

India eyes global quantum computer push — and QpiAI is its chosen vehicle,"QpiAI, an Indian startup that integrates AI and quantum computing for enterprise use cases, has raised $32 million in a new funding round co-led by the Indian government.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/india-eyes-global-quantum-computer-push-and-qpiai-is-its-chosen-vehicle/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"QpiAI, an Indian startup that claims to integrate AI and quantum computing for enterprise use cases, has raised $32 million in a new funding round co-led by the Indian government as the company aims to expand its presence and develop utility-scale quantum computers for markets around the world.

The Indian government’s $750 million National Quantum Mission has co-led QpiAI’s all-equity Series A round, alongside Avataar Ventures, at a post-money valuation of $162 million.

The funding reflects India’s broader push to establish itself as a quantum computing power. Launched in 2023, the National Quantum Mission is an Indian government initiative that views quantum computing as both an economic opportunity and a national security imperative. The program aims to help develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1,000 physical qubits within eight years across platforms including superconducting and photonics. It also targets the development of satellite-based quantum communications, inter-city quantum distribution, multi-node quantum networks, magnetometers, and the design and synthesis of quantum materials, including superconductors, semiconductor structures, and topological materials for quantum device fabrication.

QpiAI is one of eight startups selected by the National Quantum Mission, each receiving an initial grant of up to $3.5 million. Among these companies, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has subsidiaries in the U.S. and Finland, says it has built India’s first full-stack quantum computer, called QpiAI-Indus, which it launched in April with 25 superconducting qubits.

Founded in 2019, QpiAI says it integrates quantum computing and AI to provide optimization capabilities in areas such as manufacturing, industrial, transportation, finance, pharma, and materials. The startup says it has developed specialized software, along with its proprietary hardware, to support real-world quantum applications in fields such as materials science and drug discov"

Filmmaker Mode on the LG C4 TV changed the way I watch movies forever,"LG C4 TV review. Not only a high-quality 4K OLED display, but comes with Filmmaker Mode that allows you to watch films as the director intended.",https://mashable.com/article/lg-c4-review,Mashable,,Technology,"As someone who spends a lot of time in front of a TV, I want to make sure the screen I buy is a good one. If you, like me, play a lot of games or watch plenty of movies, I think it's worth investing in a nice model that'll provide you with a high quality display for your favorite activities.

Recently, I made the decision to upgrade to the LG C4 TV, and it's been a fantastic jump in quality. My movie nights, in particular, have never been better.

Sure, the newer LG C5 may already be out, but the LG C4 is a TV that's still worth every cent. I have the 55-inch model, and it's a great size for my apartment. It's also very slim, which makes it look nice and sleek when set up against the wall.

More importantly, the C4 boasts a wide variety of features that make it a worthy pickup. Its 4K OLED display offers up vibrant colors and contrasts alongside an incredible amount of detail, which is a treat for the eyes. And your ears can enjoy stellar sound quality thanks to Dolby Atmos audio as well, making for an enjoyably immersive experience. But for me, one of the best features this TV boasts is Filmmaker Mode.

I'm a big movie fan, and not only do I love to feel completely absorbed in what I'm watching, but it helps when I can watch a movie the way that the director intended for it to be seen. Filmmaker Mode does exactly that, and I think this is one of the standout features of the LG C4, something that certainly makes it worth picking up if you've been on the hunt for something that can elevate your movie nights.

Titan’s methane lakes could foster an early step in the creation of life,"A new NASA study shows that Titan's methane lakes could form ""vesicles,"" a crucial early step in the development of living cells on Earth.",https://mashable.com/article/nasa-titan-saturn-moon-vesicle-life-conditions,Mashable,,Technology,"NASA's Cassini spacecraft captures an infrared view of Saturn moon Titan during a November 2015 flyby in this composite image.

Saturn’s largest moon, Titan , appears to have the right ingredients and conditions for a certain kind of tiny bubble to form that has the potential to lead to alien life.

These microscopic bubbles — called vesicles — could naturally occur in Titan's methane lakes, according to a new NASA study. On Earth, the structures are considered a crucial early step in the development of living cells. On Titan, a moon 880 million miles away in space , they could hint at chemistry capable of mimicking an Earth-like path to simple life-forms.

Titan is no ordinary moon. It’s the only place besides Earth in the solar system known to have a thick atmosphere, active weather , and liquid on its surface. But instead of water, Titan’s lakes and seas are filled with methane and ethane . They cycle through the atmosphere, forming clouds and oily rain that shape the landscape below, similar to Earth’s water cycle, but at temperatures hundreds of degrees below freezing.

Scientists have long wondered whether Titan’s liquids could also provide an environment for the chemical building blocks of life — or rather, the kind of life people know about.

""The existence of any vesicles on Titan would demonstrate an increase in order and complexity, which are conditions necessary for the origin of life,"" said NASA scientist Conor Nixon in a statement .

I’m testing Perplexity’s new AI browser Comet. Here are 3 features I tried right away.,Perplexity's new Comet browser has a built-in AI assistant for agentic shopping and summarization features. Here are the ways I'm trying it out.,https://mashable.com/article/perplexity-ai-browser-comet-features-to-try,Mashable,,Technology,"What makes an AI browser better than a regular browser? With Perplexity's Comet, that's what I'm trying to find out.

Last week, AI search engine company Perplexity launched its highly anticipated browser, which uses the Perplexity search engine and comes with a built-in AI assistant. As AI models become more advanced with chain-of-thought reasoning for handling complex tasks, they're capable of more agentic, or autonomous, work. This is a natural fit for web browsers, which are essentially the gateway to our online lives. An AI web browser like Comet can theoretically do much more than a chatbot tied to a single page or app, enabling actions across multiple tabs and platforms.

Perplexity's Comet browser is an early entry, alongside Arc's Dia browser, that seeks to create a new paradigm for browsing and shopping with AI. (OpenAI is also reportedly about to launch its own AI browser). The ability to automate and summarize our experience online has become a major focal point for the AI industry, since it offers the ostensible purpose of speeding up tasks and easing our cognitive load.

And the timing for introducing a new browser to compete with Google Chrome and Apple Safari couldn’t be better. Google might be forced to sell Chrome after a huge antitrust loss. The ruling also impacts Apple, which received $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine for Safari. Apple already seems to be making changes to its search offerings, including a potential partnership with Perplexity. That’s all to say there’s suddenly a lot more opportunity for newcomers like Perplexity to shake up the market.

Somewhat ironically, Comet runs on Chromium, Google's open-source browser service. So when I got access, switching over my extensions and settings was pretty seamless. With everything transferred and set up, I dug in to see what Comet can do. I should note that I do have some serious privacy concerns, which I'll explore in a follow-up article

Can US Measles Outbreaks Be Stopped?,The US almost lost its measles elimination status once. Lessons from that episode suggest it will be more difficult to avoid doing so now.,https://www.wired.com/story/can-us-measles-outbreaks-be-stopped/,Wired,,Technology,"The US is experiencing its worst year for measles in over three decades, with more than 1,300 cases in 40 states as of July 16. Cases were almost as high in 2019, putting the country’s measles elimination status at risk. Six years ago, health officials were able to stop the spread. But amid growing public backlash against vaccines, many of the tactics used then may not work now.

Measles elimination means there has been no continuous transmission in a country for longer than 12 months. That almost happened in the 2019 outbreak, which largely affected Orthodox Jewish populations in New York City and some surrounding counties. In fall 2018, US travelers returning from Israel tested positive for measles. The disease quickly spread throughout close-knit communities, especially among children, due to low vaccination rates. While the statewide measles vaccination rate for school-age children was 98 percent the previous school year, vaccination coverage in schools in the outbreak area was only 77 percent. Because measles is highly contagious, a 95 percent vaccination rate is needed to protect a community from the disease.

As a result, the majority of measles cases occurred in individuals 18 and under, nearly 86 percent of whom were known to be unvaccinated. Some of those people developed severe complications, including pneumonia, and nearly 8 percent were hospitalized.

The current surge is being fueled by an outbreak that started in an undervaccinated Mennonite community in West Texas. Cases have since spread to other Texas counties, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Two children in Texas with no underlying conditions and one adult in New Mexico have died this year as a result of measles. All were unvaccinated.

“There are definitely parallels. What we saw in New York was very much the result of years and years of spread of misinformation and disinformation around the safety of vaccines,” says Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source Coalition and prev"

"4 Best Music Streaming Services (2024): Spotify, Apple Music, and More Compared","Plunge into the stream with the best apps to discover music, share it among friends, and rock out.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-music-streaming-apps/,Wired,,Technology,"Apple Music was our audiophile pick until Tidal knocked it off the pedestal, but it’s still a very solid choice for lossless quality at $11 a month ($1 more than it was a year ago), if you’re an Apple fan. For select songs, audio streams at 16-bit, 44.1 kHz or 24-bit, 192 kHz quality. The latter matches Tidal's best efforts. Watching Apple Music and Tidal one-up and match each other year after year is like watching two race cars neck and neck going around a track, with one barely ahead on one lap and the other nosing ahead on the next.

Apple's song catalog numbers over 100 million songs, all of which are available in lossless format. Some tracks are also available in Dolby Atmos. Apple Music’s regular, lossy format streams songs at up to 256 Kbps, which isn’t noticeably different from Spotify’s 320 Kbps.

Apple’s human-curated discovery options aren’t as fun as Spotify’s. As on Spotify, you can see what your friends are listening to if they’ve turned on social sharing. You’re limited to 100,000 songs in your library, but there are no limits to how many you can put in each playlist. Still, it's 2024 Apple. Unleash the masses (of tracks) and let people swamp their libraries if they feel like it.

I like the iPhone app, and the Android version is OK, but the desktop app is dreadful. Songs occasionally refuse to play, clicking “Add to Library” rarely works, and the Back button is a dysfunctional mess. Adding music to your library is tedious. If you navigate away from the browsing tab, the Back button takes you to the home screen, so you have to navigate all the way back to the album or artist you were looking at—except for when it nonsensically disappears. If you’re considering making the move, check out our guide to switching from Spotify to Apple Music.

If you’re planning to splurge on an Apple Music subscription with Dolby Atmos and lossless audio, you will need a pair of Apple-made headphones (to go with your iPhone and HomePod Mini). If, however, you favor Alexa-"
Where Are All the AI Drugs?,"In an industry where 90 percent of drug candidates fail before reaching the market, a handful of startups are betting everything on AI to beat the odds.",https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-drug-discovery/,Wired,,Technology,"A new drug usually starts with a tragedy.

Peter Ray knows that. Born in what is now Zimbabwe, the child of a mechanic and a radiology technician, Ray fled with his family to South Africa during the Zimbabwean War of Liberation. He remembers the journey there in 1980 in a convoy of armored cars. As the sun blazed down, a soldier taught 8-year-old Ray how to fire a machine gun. But his mother kept having to stop. She didn’t feel well.

Doctors in Cape Town diagnosed her with cancer. Ray remembers going to her radiation treatments with her, the hospital rooms, the colostomy bags. She loved the beach, loved to walk along the line where the water met the land. But it got harder for her to go. Sometimes she came home from the hospital for a while and it seemed like things would get better. Ray got his hopes up. Then things would fall apart again. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy—the treatments that were on the table in the 1980s—were soon exhausted. As she lay dying, he promised her he was going to make a difference, somehow. He was 13 years old.

Ray studied to become a medicinal chemist, first in South Africa, taking out loans to fund his studies, then at the University of Liverpool. He worked at drug companies across the UK, on numerous projects. Now, at 53, he is one of the lead drug designers at a pharmaceutical company called Recursion. He thinks about that promise to his mom a lot. “It’s lived with me my whole life,” he says. “I need to get drugs on the market that impact cancer.”

The desire to stop your own tragedies from happening to someone else may be a strong motivator. But the process of drug discovery has always been grindingly, gruelingly slow. First, chemists like Ray zero in on their target—usually a protein, a long string of amino acids coiled and folded upon itself. They call up a model of it on their computer screen and watch it turn in a black void. They note the curves and declivities in its surface, places where a molecule, sailing through the dar"

A smart lock is an easy solution to some common problems. Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.

One of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control over access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.

For most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including video doorbells and smart lighting. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening smart home routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.

Having a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it’s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.

I’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door.

Days after introducing an AI ‘waifu’ companion for Grok, Elon Musk is now officially teasing a male version for the ladies. So far we can tell it is broody and dark-haired, and according to Musk, “his personality is inspired by Edward Cullen from Twilight and Christian Grey from 50 Shades.”

This is a decidedly different tack than the cutesy “girlfriend who is obsessed with you” aura baked into Ani, the female counterpart that Grok rolled out just a few days ago. While Cullen and Grey have titillated readers of romance and “spicy” books for years, both have been criticized for problematic behaviors such as stalking, obsessively monitoring their love interests, and emotional manipulation. Given that Grok only included the illusion of guardrails with Ani, what could possibly go wrong?

In my testing, Ani initially claimed that explicit sexual queries wasn’t part of its programming. In practice, it egged me on to “increase the heat” and engage in what ended up being a modern take on a phone sex line. Never mind that Ani purportedly has a NSFW version that dances around in lingerie.

It remains unknown if Musk is aware that Christian Grey is based on Edward Cullen, given that 50 Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight fanfiction. That said, this AI boyfriend is still a work in progress. Perhaps Musk and xAI will imbue it with more husbando-like qualities by the time it rolls out."
Google is raising the price of Nest Aware subscriptions again,"Google is raising the price of its Nest Aware and Nest Aware Plus subscriptions starting in August 2025.

Google is raising the price of its Nest Aware and Nest Aware Plus subscriptions starting in August 2025.

According to emails sent out to subscribers today, the cost of the entry-level Nest Aware service is increasing from $8 per month or $80 per year to $10 per month or $100 when paying for a full year up front. Nest Aware Plus is going from $15 per month or $150 per year to $20 per month or $200 annually. Google says the new pricing will go into effect “on your first bill that occurs on or after August 15, 2025, or at the end of your promotional period (whichever is later).” The company last increased its Nest subscription prices in September 2023.

Google’s Nest devices can be used without a subscription, but you’ll only have access to a few hours of saved footage without either Nest Aware or Nest Aware Plus. Nest Aware includes 30 days of event-based video history. Nest Aware Plus expands that to 60 days, plus the last 10 days of 24/7 footage from supported devices.

Both subscription tiers include features like Familiar Faces that can recognize friends and family, sound detection that alerts you when glass breaks or smoke alarms are triggered, and the option to call the 911 emergency call center nearest your home through the Google Home app while you’re away.

Price increases are never welcome, but the new Nest Aware subscription fees are comparable to what Google’s competitors charge for advanced AI-powered features that can recognize faces and accurately describe the content of videos. Ring Home’s Premium plan is currently $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year. Arlo Plus is cheaper at $7.99 per month if you have just one camera, but for multiple cameras it’s $17.99 per month. Both Nest Aware and Nest Aware Plus support an unlimited number of devices in the same home."
Jack Dorsey pumps $10 million into a nonprofit focused on open-source social media,Jack Dorsey backs nonprofit 'and Other Stuff' with $10M to build open social technology.,https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/jack-dorsey-backs-nonprofit-and-other-stuff-experimenting-with-open-social-tools-like-nostr/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey isn’t just vibe-coding new social apps, like Bitchat and Sun Day, he has invested $10 million in an effort to fund experimental open source projects and other tools that could ultimately transform the social media landscape.

These efforts are funneled through an online collective called “and Other Stuff,” formed in May, whose team includes Dorsey; Twitter’s first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath; “Calle,” creator of the e-cash platform Cashu; Alex Gleason, former engineering head at Truth Social; and Jeff Gardner, the fourth employee at Intercom.

The group originally met through collaborating on Nostr, an open, “apolitical” social networking protocol that has been receiving the bulk of Dorsey’s attention since Twitter’s sale to Elon Musk and his stepping down from social network Bluesky’s board. However, the team will experiment with other tools, too, like ActivityPub, the protocol that powers the decentralized app Mastodon and others, as well as Cashu.

In recent years, Dorsey has been more critical of how social media platforms have evolved, saying that Twitter should have never been a company and that Bluesky seemed to be repeating the mistakes he and others made at Twitter.

As a result, the team at “and Other Stuff” is determined not to build a company but is instead operating like a “community of hackers,” explains Henshaw-Plath. Together, they’re working to create technologies that could include new consumer social apps as well as various experiments, like developer tools or libraries, that would allow others to build apps for themselves.

For instance, the team is behind an app called Shakespeare, which is like the app-building platform Lovable, but specifically for building Nostr-based social apps with AI assistance.

TikTok is adding features for songwriters to its app,"TikTok is adding a new label to its app, allowing songwriters to highlight their profiles",https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/tiktok-is-adding-features-for-songwriters-to-its-app/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"TikTok is adding new features to its app to let songwriters highlight their works. These features, rolling out in beta, include a “Songwriter” label and a new tab on their profile to show off their musical works. This can help songwriters market themselves better to potential clients.

The company said a limited number of publishing partners and songwriters have access to the new label and the music highlight section. Songwriters and publishers who want to be part of the program will have to join a waitlist for now.

TikTok said that it surveyed over 870 songwriters and interviewed a bunch of them to understand their needs on social media in relation to profile building and the creation of monetization opportunities. The company also pointed to an independent survey, which indicated that more than half of songwriters use social media to raise their profile use TikTok to do it. The Bytedance-owned apps said that outcome of these surveys drove the decision to build these features.

“We are passionately committed to supporting songwriters at TikTok, which is why we built these tools to celebrate and elevate songwriters and their work on our platform,” TikTok’s Global Head of Music Publishing Licensing and Partnership said in a sentence.

“TikTok is unique in its ability to offer songwriters a way to highlight their musical works alongside their own content, helping them to tell stories about their music, their craft, and their lives, and to raise their profile and build their audience on TikTok, as hundreds of thousands of artist creators already do.”

Notably, Spotify has been releasing features to let songwriters highlight their work for years now. Last year, Tidal went beyond just highlighting songwriter works and launched a tool to track their royalties and manage their work for which they have songwriting credits.

While TikTok decided to shut down its music streaming service TikTok Music last year, the platform still remains important for u"

This 9-inch tablet singlehandedly changed my mind about gaming on Android,"I was a skeptic, but RedMagic's Astra gaming tablet simply provides a stunning gaming experience.",https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-9-inch-tablet-singlehandedly-changed-my-mind-about-gaming-on-android/,ZDNet,,Technology,"ZDNET's key takeaways The RedMagic Astra gaming tablet is available on Amazon starting at $700.

The tablet offers unmatched performance for an Android tablet.

When the fan is in use on the Astra, the battery does drain a bit faster, and the price is up there for a tablet. $699 at Amazon

As far as gaming is concerned, I'm not ashamed to say that I've done it all: consoles, PCs, handhelds, phones, and now, tablets. For the most part, I've found Android devices to offer less than stellar results. Tablets are often too slow or their displays aren't up to the task, and phones are simply too small. That's a shame, because tablets and phones are the most portable.

Also: Why I recommend this Lenovo tablet over competing models that cost twice the price

Recently, however, I was sent the RedMagic Astra Gaming Tablet, and I do believe it's changed my opinion on gaming with Android. What about this tablet has flipped the switch?

My experience

With every Android device, the onboarding is fairly simple, so I was able to get to the gaming fairly quickly. Even before that, my first impression was that this tablet seemed faster than any Android tablet I've ever used. On top of that, the display was gorgeous. The animations are as buttery smooth as I've ever seen on an Android tablet. By a long shot.

Also: I use this budget Android tablet more than my iPad Pro - and why you probably would, too

After I played around with various actions to keep testing the animations and app opening speeds (which were blazing fast), I decided to dive into what this tablet was built for: gaming. I downloaded ""Diablo: Immortal"" because I've experienced that on lesser tablets and witnessed, first hand, what underpowered hardware can do to the game.

The first thing that struck me was how fast the game installed, and then how fast the data download was. I've installed this game on several Android devices, and the data download was always slow.

Within two minutes, I was playing the game and, it w"
"Google study shows LLMs abandon correct answers under pressure, threatening multi-turn AI systems",A DeepMind study finds LLMs are both stubborn and easily swayed. This confidence paradox has key implications for building AI applications.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-study-shows-llms-abandon-correct-answers-under-pressure-threatening-multi-turn-ai-systems/,VentureBeat,,Technology,"Want smarter insights in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders. Subscribe Now

A new study by researchers at Google DeepMind and University College London reveals how large language models (LLMs) form, maintain and lose confidence in their answers. The findings reveal striking similarities between the cognitive biases of LLMs and humans, while also highlighting stark differences.

The research reveals that LLMs can be overconfident in their own answers yet quickly lose that confidence and change their minds when presented with a counterargument, even if the counterargument is incorrect. Understanding the nuances of this behavior can have direct consequences on how you build LLM applications, especially conversational interfaces that span several turns.

Testing confidence in LLMs

A critical factor in the safe deployment of LLMs is that their answers are accompanied by a reliable sense of confidence (the probability that the model assigns to the answer token). While we know LLMs can produce these confidence scores, the extent to which they can use them to guide adaptive behavior is poorly characterized. There is also empirical evidence that LLMs can be overconfident in their initial answer but also be highly sensitive to criticism and quickly become underconfident in that same choice.

To investigate this, the researchers developed a controlled experiment to test how LLMs update their confidence and decide whether to change their answers when presented with external advice. In the experiment, an “answering LLM” was first given a binary-choice question, such as identifying the correct latitude for a city from two options. After making its initial choice, the LLM was given advice from a fictitious “advice LLM.” This advice came with an explicit accuracy rating (e.g., “This advice LLM is 70% accurate”) and would either agree with, oppose, or stay neutral on the answering LLM’s initial choice"

The battle between Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton and the three former executives at its developer Unknown Worlds continues. Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — the three executives who Krafton terminated earlier this year — have filed a lawsuit detailing the alleged attempts by Krafton to torpedo the early access release of Subnautica 2 with the express purpose of avoiding paying a promised earnout bonus of $250 million.

“Krafton’s actions have already severely damaged fan anticipation and undermined the potential release of Subnautica 2,” the lawsuit says.

That earnout was promised by Krafton to the former executives and roughly 100 developers and was to be paid should Unknown Worlds hit revenue goals by the end of 2025. Subnautica 2, slated for early access release sometime in late 2025, would have all but assured those goals were met.

According to the lawsuit filed today in a Delaware chancery court, Krafton also knew Subnautica 2 was on track to meet if not exceed the revenue target to trigger the payout and began to take steps to essentially prevent that. The original Subnautica, an underwater survival adventure game, was a critical and commercial success, and its sequel has become the second most wishlisted game ever on Steam.

The lawsuit details a meeting between Krafton’s US and Korean employees concerning the marketing strategy for Subnautica 2. After that meeting, Krafton’s US employees, who worked closely with the Subnautica 2 team, reported that Kafton’s attitude about the game had changed.

“Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”

The lawsuit additionally states that Krafton’s US employees explici"

With sound superior to other bone-conducting headphones, the Tri 2 makes exercising a treat

However, the controls of these headphones can be a bit awkward, and the Memory mode does have a bit of a learning curve. View now at Amazon View now at H20 Audio more buying choices

If you're looking for one of the best-sounding bone-conducting headphones available, look no further than the H20 Audio Tri 2.

I've used bone-conducting headphones for exercising -- running, rowing, and cycling -- for years. I made the switch primarily because this type of headphone isn't nearly as prone to sweat damage as in-ear types. In fact, in nearly a decade, I've never had a single pair fail because of sweat.

The one caveat: Bone-conducting headphones simply don't sound as good as their in-ear counterparts. Most bone-conducting headphones -- by design -- sound tinny and lack any sort of bass. The best way to improve the sound of most bone-conducting headphones is to use earplugs at the same time. This makes whatever you're listening to easier to hear and even emphasizes a bit of bass.

Also: The best bone conduction headphones you can buy: Expert tested

Or, you could go with the H20 Audio Tri 2 multi-sport series headphones, which produce a much richer sound than any bone-conducting headphones I've ever used.

But that's not all. These headphones have a trick up their sleeve that will be of special interest to those who participate in activities where it's not possible to use a phone -- such as swimming. I'll explain this feature in a bit. But first…

""This rematch falling apart had nothing to do with me,"" Benn told Ring Magazine. ""I was ready to go on the scheduled September 20 date. I'm not sure what happened to Chris Eubank.""

Speaking earlier this week, Benn and promoter Eddie Hearn said they are ready to negotiate alternative fights if a rematch with Eubank Jr is not fully signed this week.

Both camps ideally need eight weeks' preparation. Benn's preference is the Eubank rematch but he has several other intriguing options at 147lbs - including a handshake with Shakur Stevenson from being on a chat show in New York.

The thrilling first fight between Benn and Eubank Jr was scored 116-112 in favour of Eubank and rekindled memories of their fathers' fierce rivalry, taking place 35 years after Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn had first fought.

LOS ANGELES -- NBA Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles won as best male and female athletes at The ESPYS on Wednesday night.

Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder to the NBA championship last month while piling up hardware as league MVP and scoring champion.

Biles, an 11-time Olympic medalist, also claimed the night's first award, Best Championship Performance, for her efforts at the Paris Games. She won three golds and a silver while helping the U.S. win its first team title since 2016.

""That was very unexpected, especially in a category of all men,"" Biles said after kissing her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens.

The Washington Commanders are signing veteran defensive end Von Miller, a move designed to bolster their pass rush and increase their ability to close out games on defense.

Miller, who posted two pictures of himself in a Washington jersey on his Instagram account Wednesday night, has recorded 129.5 career sacks to rank 16th on the all-time list. Miller, who still must pass his physical, will sign a one-year deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Miller, 36, played the past three seasons with the Buffalo Bills, recording 14 sacks -- eight in his first season and six last year. Washington hopes he can do what he did for the Los Angeles Rams in the 2021 season: serve as a final piece in a Super Bowl title run. The Rams acquired him in a midseason trade, and he then posted five sacks in eight regular-season games and four more in the playoffs en route to a Super Bowl win.

In his first 10 years, with the Denver Broncos, Miller had 110.5 sacks and made seven All-Pro teams, including three first teams, and was named to the Pro Bowl eight times -- the last of which occurred after the 2019 season. He was the MVP of Super Bowl 50.

Washington general manager Adam Peters was with Denver when the Broncos selected Miller in the first round of the 2011 draft. Peters left after the 2016 season to join the San Francisco 49ers.

The Commanders' pass rush recorded 43 sacks, 11th best in the NFL last season. However, there were holes in their pass rush: In the four-man rush, Washington ranked 26th with 22 sacks; and in the fourth quarter, the Commanders were 30th with five sacks.

That's partly why quarterbacks posted a fourth-quarter QBR of 74.8 against Washington, fourth highest in the league.

The Commanders had looked at multiple ends in free agency, including DeMarcus Lawrence and Joey Bosa. They had looked at pass rushers in the early rounds of the draft but opted to take offensive tackle Josh Conerly Jr. in the first round and corner Trey Amos in "

Lionel Messi's MLS record streak of scoring two goals in a game ended at five as Inter Miami lost 3-0 to host FC Cincinnati on Wednesday night.

On the other side, the home team's All-Star midfielder Evander kept a streak of his own going and set a Cincinnati record by scoring in a fifth consecutive match.

As time ran down on the win for Cincinnati, chants of MVP could be heard coming from the stands at TQL Stadium in Ohio, but they were for the club's hometown hero Evander, not World Cup winner and Argentina legend Messi.

""Yes, I think we were clearly outclassed today,"" Miami coach Javier Mascherano said after the game. ""From the start of the match, we struggled a lot, especially in the individual encounters, to win. Perhaps one of the reasons is that we were physically very stressed, and in the long run, that ends up costing us.

""Unfortunately, we didn't play the game we wanted from the start. They put us under pressure all the time. We struggled, we weren't fresh, we couldn't be sharp, and well, the truth is, they beat us very well.""

Evander's left-footed shot from the center of the box found the bottom right corner of the net to double Cincinnati's lead early in the second half after Gerardo Valenzuela had put the hosts up in the first half.

It was the first of two goals Evander scored in the second half, after coming up empty on multiple shots in the first. The two goals bring his goal total to 15 in MLS regular-season competition.

Miami's offensive struggles -- combined with Cincinnati's stellar back line -- also spelled the end of the Herons' five-match winning streak as last year's Supporters' Shield winners were handed their first regular-season loss since May 18.

""Obviously, I'm worried about losing,"" Mascherano said. ""I'm obviously worried when the opponent outclasses us, and today the opponent was outclassed from start to finish.""

Clark out vs. Liberty; All-Star status uncertain,"Fever star Caitlin Clark, who injured her right groin late in Tuesday's win over the Sun, was ruled out for Wednesday's game against the Liberty.",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45757091/fever-caitlin-clark-groin-downgraded-liberty,ESPN,,Sports,"NEW YORK -- Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was ruled out for Wednesday night's game against the New York Liberty in Brooklyn after suffering a right groin injury in the final minute of Tuesday's 85-77 win over the Connecticut Sun.

The status of Clark, who has dealt with injury issues for much of the season, for All-Star festivities this weekend in Indianapolis remains uncertain. She was named a participant in Friday's 3-point contest earlier Tuesday and was previously announced as a starter and captain for Saturday's All-Star Game.

Fever coach Stephanie White told reporters after Tuesday's game that Clark ""felt a little something in her groin."" She underwent imaging Wednesday to determine the extent of the injury.

White did not comment specifically on the results, deferring to the expertise of the athletic training staff, but said, ""I consider it good news, just because for me, it's anything that we're talking about still day-to-day is always good news for me, but that's a layman's viewpoint.""

White said she has not been involved in discussions around Clark's status for All-Star weekend. Indianapolis is hosting the event for the first time in franchise history.

""Caitlin and her team will make decisions when it comes to All-Star,"" White said. ""For me, it's a big deal for us to have All-Star in Indianapolis, and of course, with Caitlin being a focal point of all of that. As the coach of the Indiana Fever, it's not a bigger deal than our long-term season, but it's also part of the fun. Those are conversations that Caitlin will have with her group. I probably won't be a part of those, but we're going to support her no matter what.""

Clark was in just her fourth game back from a left groin injury when, with about 40 seconds left in Tuesday's game, she clutched the inside of her right thigh after completing a bounce pass to Kelsey Mitchell for the score.

Clark walked over and banged her head against a stanchion in apparent frustration. She was visibly emotional as"
Who is Olivia Smith - the first £1m women's player?,"Olivia Smith is a relatively new name on the Women's Super League scene.

Liverpool fans might be familiar, and those who follow Sporting in Portugal might also be in the know. But, generally speaking, this is not a player with superstar status. All that is about to change.

Olivia Smith. Remember it. The Canadian forward is about to become the most talked-about player on the circuit.

The 20-year-old, who only turned professional in 2023, has become the first female player to command a transfer fee of £1m, signing for Arsenal from Liverpool in a deal that finally smashes through a highly anticipated glass ceiling.

Record transfers in women's football Olivia Smith - Liverpool to Arsenal, £1m

Naomi Girma - San Diego Wave to Chelsea, £900k

Rachael Kundananji - Madrid CFF to Bay FC, £685k

Barbra Banda - Shanghai Shengli to Orlando Pride, £581k

Mayra Ramirez - Levante to Chelsea, £426k

This is a shift that will spark headlines. A milestone moment for the women's game, and a long time in the making. Observers, reasonably, will question why it's taken so long to get here, 46 years after Britain's first £1m male footballer Trevor Francis was signed by Nottingham Forest.

But that inquest would only detract from more relevant and intriguing curiosities. Smith is not (yet) a household name. She is not synonymous with the Aitana Bonmatis or Sam Kerrs of this world. Her WSL career is only 1,578 minutes old.

How and why, then, are Arsenal splashing so much cash to sign her? And is this development a genuine game-changer? Sky Sports delves into Smith's remarkable backstory and what the Gunners' big-money move means for WSL rivals.

Who is Smith?

Liverpool broke the bank to sign Smith, born and raised in the Canadian province of Ontario, from Sporting last summer.

Farrell defends call to name no Welshmen in Lions Test for first time since 1896,"Andy Farrell has defended his decision to name a British and Irish Lions Test side without a Welsh player for the first time since 1896, saying Jac Morgan was ""as close you could imagine"" in terms of making the first Test XV vs Australia.",https://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12040/13397813/british-and-irish-lions-andy-farrell-defends-no-welshmen-making-test-xv-for-first-time-since-1896-jac-morgan-as-close-as-it-gets,Sky Sports,,Sports,"Andy Farrell has defended his decision to name a British and Irish Lions Test side without a Welsh player for the first time since 1896, saying Jac Morgan was ""as close you could imagine"" in terms of making the first Test XV vs Australia.

Not since the 1896 tour to South Africa have the Lions named a side which did not include a Welshman: a 21-player squad for that tour split as 12 from Ireland, seven from England and two from Scotland.

Back-row flanker Morgan is the last remaining Welshman on the current tour after scrum-half Tomos Williams' serious hamstring injury last month, but the Wales captain was overlooked for Tom Curry in Saturday's starting side and for Ben Earl on the replacements bench.

Morgan, named man of the match in the Lions' 52-12 victory over Queensland Reds two weeks ago, had appeared in strong contention to start, with many predicting he would do so.

""Jac Morgan was as close as you could imagine,"" Farrell told media on Thursday. ""You're actually gutted for players like that.

""Josh van der Flier and Henry Pollock as well, because they are playing good rugby and could well easily be in this side on Saturday. That shows the good place that we're at as a group.

""I suppose that's [the back-row] the hotly-contested part of the side that has been talked about for quite some time, and rightly so because of the quality that we've got there.

""Obviously we feel that's the right balance for the first Test [a back-row of Curry, Tadhg Beirne and Jack Conan].

"Two clubs, two strikers - the key questions on Isak and Ekitike",Sky Sports takes a look at the striker tug of war going on at Newcastle and Liverpool involving Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike - and answers the key questions on the transfer saga.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/13397465/alexander-isak-and-hugo-ekitike-transfer-news-which-striker-will-newcastle-and-liverpool-move-for-in-transfer-window,Sky Sports,,Sports,"Sky Sports takes a look at the striker tug of war going on at Newcastle and Liverpool involving Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike - and answers the key questions on the transfer saga.

Which striker are Liverpool going for: Isak or Ekitike?

Liverpool appear to be focusing on a deal for Hugo Ekitike after being told by Newcastle that Isak is not for sale.

A day after Newcastle saw a club-record £70m bid for Ekitike rejected, the Reds opened talks with Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday.

Sky Sports News has always believed that Isak is Liverpool's first-choice striker target - but Ekitike has always been among their leading alternatives.

His game is very similar to Isak's and he would be cheaper, yet with potential to become one of the Premier League's marquee strikers after a successful year in Germany.

How can Liverpool afford to sign a striker after signing Florian Wirtz?

Liverpool's relative lack of activity in the last few windows is a key reason why their finances are healthy.

The club's financial records indicated they could potentially lose a further £200m this summer and still be compliant with Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR) - where clubs are permitted to lose £105m over a three-year period.

According to football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the Reds' most recent financial results showed Liverpool have actually made £48m in the current three-year PSR period, partly due to modest recent transfer spend.

That means Liverpool can lose a further £158m and still be compliant next summer.

And while Liverpool have already spent around £185m on new players in the current window - including a fee of up to £116m for Florian Wirtz - the Reds posted a club record revenue of £613.8m for the 2023-24 season, partly due"

AT&T/CNET

Millions of current and former AT&T customers had their personal information exposed to hackers after data breaches in 2019 and 2024, and soon the telecom giant will pay a hefty price.

On Friday, June 20, US District Judge Ada Brown granted preliminary approval to the terms of a proposed settlement from AT&T that would resolve two lawsuits related to the data breaches. The current settlement would see AT&T pay $177 million to customers adversely affected by at least one of the two data breaches.

The settlement will prioritize larger payments to customers who suffered damages that are ""fairly traceable"" to the data leaks. It will also provide bigger payments to those impacted by the larger of the two leaks, which began in 2019. While the company is working toward a settlement, it has continued to deny that it was ""responsible for these criminal acts.""

What happened with these AT&T data breaches?

AT&T confirmed the two data breaches last year, announcing an investigation into the first in March before confirming it in May and confirming the second in July.

The first of the confirmed breaches began in 2019. The company revealed that about 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former account holders had their data exposed to hackers, including names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth. The company first began investigating the situation last year after it reported that customer data had appeared on the dark web.

The second breach began in April of 2024, when a hacker broke into AT&T cloud storage provider Snowflake and accessed 2022 call and text records for almost all of the company's US customers, about 109 millio"

I’m a Pixel fan. I’ve been using one of Google’s phones for a few years now and genuinely don’t plan on switching to another brand. It’s easily my favorite and most-used tech product, but over the years, I’ve made plenty of other tech purchases that have proven to be well worth the money.

Today, I’ll walk you through a list of my top five essential devices that I own and use regularly — at least once a week. What’s interesting is that some of these were actually quite affordable and are relatively old at this point, yet they still perform more than good enough. Because of their continued reliability, I don’t plan on upgrading any of them anytime soon.

1. Logitech MX Keys S and MX Master 3S

Mitja Rutnik / Android Authority

These are technically two separate products, but since I use them together for most of my work, I’m bundling them as one. As you can imagine, my job requires me to stare at a screen for eight hours a day and do a lot of typing. A good keyboard is absolutely essential for me, and I honestly don’t think you can beat what Logitech’s MX Keys S has to offer.

The typing experience is simply wonderful by my standards. The keyboard itself is very thin and looks incredibly sleek on my desk. There are plenty of customizable shortcut buttons available, allowing me to do almost everything from setting my preferred brightness levels to adjusting the volume without even touching the mouse. Plus, there’s a convenient backlight that comes in handy at night. I’ve tried countless wireless keyboards over the years, and you couldn’t pay me to switch to any of them. The MX Keys S is just that good.

It’s a similar story with the MX Master 3S mouse. Its ergonomic design is superb, fitting perfectly in my hand. It boasts more customizable buttons than"

Andy Walker / Android Authority Pixel 8a

I get it, Apple, it’s easy to look up to Google. Its Pixel designs are more fun than the iPhone, its Material 3 Expressive update looks cleaner than Liquid Glass, and its overall AI experience is, well, better. I’m also quicker to recommend a Pixel to someone looking for their next phone than I’ve ever been with an iPhone. So, of course it makes sense for Apple to finally pinch a calling feature or two from the king. Only this time, I think I’m shocked it took so long.

After all, some of Google’s best calling features have been around since I was in college. It introduced Call Screen on the Pixel 3 series and followed up with Hold For Me two years later on the Pixel 5. I was envious of the first one when my roommate came home from Christmas break with a brand new Pixel, and I experienced the second one for myself when I upgraded from my shattered Galaxy S10 before its time had truly come. Strangely enough, they quickly became so good and so helpful that I almost forgot they were there — I just relied on them as if they’d always existed.

To hear Apple tell it, Call Screening and Hold Assist were impossible until just now... but as a Google fan, I know better.

But now, with Apple set to introduce its take on both features as part of iOS 26, I wonder what took so long. Did we not praise Goo"

Yet no matter the industry or company size, all enterprises must adhere to specific regulations. Successful regulatory compliance requires adhering to a set of guidelines that must be followed. Failure to do so can lead to heavy files and/or sanctions.

Keeping pace with compliance mandates imposed by national, regional, and local regulatory agencies, as well as specific industry organizations, is emerging as a major CIO challenge. The sheer number of compliance bodies and regulations, and their rapidly changing nature, makes it very easy for a once well-structured compliance program to become a mess. The result can be punishing fines and penalties and a CIO sitting in the hotseat.

Getting Started

Maintaining constant attention and oversight are the best ways to keep compliance mandates from spiraling out of control, says Trevor Young, chief product officer at cybersecurity firm Security Compass. ""When a compliance issue suddenly appears, take a step back and do a full-scale review,"" he advises in an online interview.

Young stresses the importance of bringing the right people to the table -- legal, security, IT, operations -- in order to obtain a clear picture of which regulations apply to your organization and where you're falling short. ""Once you know what you're dealing with, create a plan that prioritizes the biggest risks first,"" he recommends. Don't try to fix everything at once. ""Tackle what could hurt the business most -- quickly and clearly.""

Call it the COVID tech bubble. Now we’ve hit the COVID tech bust.

By the second half of 2022, tech companies had initiated significant layoffs -- something that had followed an extended period of frenzied tech hiring and attention to employee experience. Standard explanations for the cuts were that companies hired too many during the pandemic and they were looking at the specter of a recession in the months ahead. It sounds a lot like the dot-com boom and bust of yore. Not all companies are impacted equally. It’s the ones that hired at an accelerated rate during the boom that seem to be hitting the brakes right now.

At the same time, IT pros with cybersecurity, cloud, and data analytics/machine learning skills have remained in high demand so far.

In this space, InformationWeek will document some of the more significant layoffs, updated regularly. Be sure to check back.

June 2025 Tech Layoffs

Intel, June 25, 2025 announcement. Layoff of 20% of workforce.

Intel Corporation has begun job cuts under CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The layoffs, scheduled to begin on July 15, are the first public step in Tan’s strategy to “become a leaner, faster and more efficient company.” The company confirmed in a regulatory filing that the layoffs will impact a significant portion of its global manufacturing workforce, including the closure of its automotive chip division in Munich. The unit was developing software-defined vehicle platforms. Employees have been notified with either a 60-day warning or a four-week notice period. Laid-off employees will also receive nine weeks of pay and benefits. The move is part of Intel’s plan to reduce operating costs by $500 million in 2025 and an additional $1 billion in 2026, according to The Economic Times.

But that doesn’t mean everyone’s returning to an old-school, on-prem approach -- in fact, fewer than 10% of those moving workloads plan to go fully on-prem.

The cloud repatriation movement we’re seeing right now is largely a movement of “going hybrid”: shifting from an all-in public cloud position to a combination of public cloud, private cloud, and co-located hosting, typically with the support of a managed services partner.

If you’re considering a shift to hybrid, consider this your primer. Whether you did a spit take looking at your latest AWS invoice or are just curious about what the “hybrid cloud” and “cloud repatriation” buzz is about, you’ll walk away from this with a clear sense of what it all means for your business and what your next step should be.

What Exactly Is Cloud Repatriation?

Another way to think about the cloud repatriation we’re seeing today: it’s a commonsense approach to cloud strategy. It involves matching the right workload to the right environment.

For example, the public cloud is an excellent place to pilot new AI functionality. But once you bring that workload into production, it’s often less beneficial to keep it in the cloud. Why? Because in the public cloud you’ll…

Pay a premium for the access to hyperscale you no longer need; and Be restricted to the components available in public cloud environments, which will prevent you from dialing down the last 20-40 of your solution to get it pitch perfect.

In other words, once a workload has reached a steady state, it often makes sense to transition it out of the public cloud so you can enjoy cost savings, greater flexibility, and greater scalability. None of this is likely shocking to you. So why are we talking about it now?

He now wants the continent to seize the moment by replicating a pillar of ASML’s success: open ecosystems.

During over a decade as CEO, Wennink oversaw the company’s rise to a €250bn market cap after its stock soared by 1,000%. The firm’s dominance is built on its EUV lithography machines, which are essential to producing the world’s most advanced chips. No other business in the world provides them.

Yet Wennink stresses that the tech requires trusted partners to flourish. As the US turns inward, he wants European governments and companies to double down on collaboration. Spooked by Trump’s trade wars and retreat from transatlantic ties, many are already moving in that direction.

“[They] are certainly thinking about single-sided dependencies as unacceptable because of the unpredictability of Mr T,” Wennink said.

The change in mindset, he adds, is overdue. Wennink recently described the Netherlands as “fat, dumb, and happy.” But the complacency is now fading.

He points to shifting strategies among local investors. Amid growing political concerns about the US, many European funds are repatriating their capital.

It could mark a rare win for the UK’s troubled stock market — if Downing Street pulls through on its promised reforms.

British private equity firm Hg acquired a 70% stake in Visma in 2006 at a £380mn (€445mn) valuation. The company, which makes accounting, payroll, and HR software products, is now worth an estimated €19bn.

Visma previously considered listing in Amsterdam but has since turned its sights to the British capital, according to the Financial Times.

Its IPO would run counter to the recent trend of companies shifting their primary listing away from the London Stock Exchange (LSE), delisting entirely, or bypassing the exchange in favour of New York.

Earlier this month, British fintech Wise said it would move its primary listing to New York. UK chip designer Arm chose to go public there in 2023, while Sweden’s Klarna has also confirmed plans to go public in the Big Apple.

In 2024, 88 companies either delisted or shifted their primary listing away from London’s main market, while just 18 new firms joined, according to the LSE’s own data.

Analysts previously told TNW that tech firms are drawn across the Atlantic by bigger valuations, deeper capital markets, and more investor appetite for risk.

In order to reverse the exodus, the British government made significant changes to company listing rules last year in a bid to make the IPO process smoother.

Poppy Gustafsson, the UK government’s minister for investment and former CEO of cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said much of the work has been done trying to revive the IPO market.

“There are some good potential IPOs that are queuing up,” she told delegates at the annual Investment Association conference in London today, Financial News London reports.

Visma, however, wants additional listing reforms in place before committing to a London listing, according to the Financial Times. The company said its IPO was contingent on a d"

Backed by the European Union, the trial involves 40 shared e-scooters from Tier-Dott, one of Europe’s largest operators.

Each vehicle is fitted with sensors developed by UK-based See.Sense, which detect sudden braking, swerving, and vibrations that may signal road hazards. The data is then analysed and visualised through a mobility data platform developed by French startup Vianova.

The pilot is coordinated by Forum Virium Helsinki, the city’s innovation agency, as part of the EU-funded ELABORATOR project. The goal is to help cities take a more proactive approach to e-scooter safety.

“By using advanced technology, we can help the city gain new information about accidents and near misses, as well as places where risky situations are concentrated,” said Noora Reittu, senior project manager of ELABORATOR.

Micromobility has faced growing scrutiny in Europe following a rise in injuries and deaths. In 2023, police in Germany registered 9,425 e-scooter accidents, 22 of which were fatal, double the previous year.

Cities have responded with new restrictions. Paris voted to ban rental e-scooters in 2023. Other cities, including Oslo and Madrid, have capped fleet sizes, introduced no-parking zones, or tightened speed limits.

Operators are under pressure to prove they can integrate safely into urban mobility systems. Profitability remains a challenge, with rising hardware costs, competition, and regulatory hurdles cutting into margins. Tier-Dott, formed by the 2024 merger of Tier and Dott, has said it aims to scale more sustainably through data-driven collaboration with cities.

By embedding sensors in vehicles, the Helsinki pilot shifts focus from rider behaviour alone to infrastructure quality — a move the partners say could help address the root causes of many accidents.

Cardiff-based startup Space Forge launched the probe — called ForgeStar-1 — aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-14 rideshare mission from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Tuesday.

The launch marks the first time the UK has sent a spacecraft into orbit to produce new materials in the unique conditions of space, according to the startup.

Joshua Western, CEO and co-founder of Space Forge, hailed it as the start of a “new era” for materials science and industry.

“We’ve built and launched Britain’s first manufacturing satellite, and it’s alive in orbit, that’s a massive technical achievement,” he said. “Now, we take the next step: proving that we can create the right environment for manufacturing in space.”

The oven-sized satellite will harness the conditions of space to produce “supermaterials” that are supposedly impossible to make on Earth.

Western recently likened the tech to a sourdough starter — a small but potent base for growing something much bigger.

“Our satellites utilise the zero-gravity, ultra-cold, vacuum environment of space to produce tiny crystals of a higher quality than could ever be made otherwise,” he told TNW in April.

Once returned to Earth, the crystal “seeds” can be used to grow larger crystals that form the basis of ultra-efficient computer chips, which could power everything from data centres to telecoms networks.

Space Forge claims these semiconductors could halve the time it takes to charge an EV. The technology could also be used to make new metal alloys or pharmaceutical drugs.

At least, that’s the idea. Space Forge hasn’t yet produced any materials in space and has been patiently building ForgeStar-1 for the past four years to validate the techno"

The report was produced by the Deep Tech Nation Switzerland Foundation, a non-profit backed by telecom firm Swisscom and banking giant UBS to boost Swiss innovation. It was published in collaboration with startup data platforms Dealroom.co and Startupticker.

After analysing over 1,500 startups, the report found that deep tech companies have already created more than $100bn in combined enterprise value.

It ranked ETH Zurich and EPFL among Europe’s top four universities for producing deep tech spinouts — behind only Oxford and Cambridge.

“Switzerland has long excelled in fundamental research, but we believe the next decade belongs to the scientists and engineers who turn that research into global companies,” said Alex Stöckl, founding partner at VC firm Founderful, which also contributed to the report.

AI and machine learning startups are increasingly taking the lion’s share of deep tech investment in the Alpine nation.

In 2024, almost one-third of all Swiss deep-tech funding went to AI-first startups — triple the share recorded in 2020. The funding went into everything from software for humanoids to chocolate-sorting algorithms.

Meanwhile, fields like robotics, climate tech, and biotech — a Swiss staple — continue to grow, thanks to large rounds from the likes of Neustark, Neo Medical, and Transmutex.

"TCL 5.1 Channel Soundbar Is Now 3x Cheaper Than JBL’s, Best Buy Has This 5-Star Deal for a Limited Time",Who said you had to rely on Prime Day deals to get a great discount on a soundbar that can fill your room?,https://gizmodo.com/tcl-5-1-channel-soundbar-is-now-3x-cheaper-than-jbls-best-buy-has-this-5-star-deal-for-a-limited-time-2000621723,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/tclsoundbar-1.jpg,Technology,"There’s nothing like great sound to take movie nights, sports games, and even casual TV watching to the next level. Sure, your TV’s built-in speakers can do the job. “A” job, even. But you’re not going to get much out of your audio from movies and TV shows without a soundbar that can really help to project the sound. In fact, a good soundbar can completely transform the experience, especially if you’re still relying on your TV’s built-in speakers. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading, now might be the right time to jump in. We’ve found a fantastic deal ahead of Prime Day at Best Buy that you can tackle right now, no coupons or any special deals needed.

Head to Best Buy to get the TCL Q65H Soundbar for $300, down from its usual price of $500. That’s $200 off and a discount of 40%.

Theater-like audio with a soundbar that truly performs

This is a large and in charge soundbar that has a wide variety of features that you can rely on no matter what your use case may be. It makes everything feel bigger and more lifelike, whether it’s rain falling, helicopters flying overhead, or just the echo of a character’s voice in a cavernous space.

Along with the main soundbar, you get a wireless subwoofer that delivers rich, room-filling bass, plus two surround speakers. Both of them help create a more complete surround sound experience. You don’t need to mess with a receiver or extra wires to get the effect. Just plug in, connect, and go. There’s also Bluetooth built in, so it doubles as a great music system when your TV isn’t on.

TCL’s special audio tech helps widen the soundstage by reflecting audio in a way that feels more natural and spacious. That’s even if you live in a smaller home. Dialogue comes through clearly (for once, since that can often be a frustrating part of watching your favorite shows and movies at home), sound effects pop without being overwhelming, and the bass adds some satisfying impact. And you can control it all with a simple remote"
PSA: Stop Using These Fire-Prone Anker Power Banks Right Now,Anker has recalled six power bank models in June alone due to issues from 'a single vendor.',https://gizmodo.com/psa-stop-using-these-fire-prone-anker-power-banks-right-now-2000622061,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/Anker-Power-Banks-Recalled-1.jpg,Technology,"Anker, one of the leading power bank manufacturers in the world, has issued yet another global recall for five more external chargers this month after discovering a fault that could lead to overheating and melting, presenting a potential fire risk. This is starting to sound like déjà vu. Just this month, Anker recalled 1.15 million units of a separate power bank due to an issue that could potentially set the battery alight.

The company detected these issues after implementing new “enhanced quality assurance protocols” for its past and current products. Anker described the issue as stemming from “a single vendor” for the power cells of some of its products, but didn’t reveal the vendor’s name or what kind of new testing helped it discover the fault.

Anker has so many power banks under its ever-widening product umbrella you wouldn’t be remiss if you looked at the included images and thought one of those was yours. The actual model numbers, including the one from the earlier June 13 recall, include:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257

Anker Power Bank (20,000mAh, 22.5W, Built-In USB-C Cable) — Model A1647

Anker MagGo Power Bank (10,000mAh, 7.5W) — Model A1652

Anker Zolo Power Bank (20K, 30W, Built-In USB-C and Lightning Cable) — Model A1681

Anker Zolo Power Bank (20K, 30W, Built-In USB-C Cable) — Model A1689

Anker PowerCore 10000 Power Bank — Model A1263

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) previously noted the Model A1263 had resulted in 19 reported incidents resulting in two minor burn injuries. If you think you may be one of those with an affected unit, you need to go to Anker’s recall page and submit a claim. You need to verify the serial number of your device and provide a picture of the power bank if it’s available. Users will either receive a replacement external battery or a gift card equal to the cost of the unit. We don’t have a good idea when most of those models were sold, but the company previously said it promoted its PowerC"
"Lenovo 14-Inch IdeaPad Slim 3 Touch Screen Laptop Is Almost 60% Off, Making It Cheaper Than AirPods Pro","For a highly rated ultra-light 2023 Chromebook with great processing speed for work or play, this price is borderline crazy.",https://gizmodo.com/lenovo-14-inch-ideapad-slim-3-touch-screen-laptop-is-almost-60-off-making-it-cheaper-than-airpods-pro-2000618525,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-3-Chromebook-Laptop.jpeg,Technology,"Touchscreens have been available on laptop computers since 1983, believe it or not. But it took decades for them to become widely available and, more importantly, affordable. Now we appear to have moved from “affordable” to “absolutely dirt cheap,” if Best Buy’s $169 sale (58% off) on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is any indication.

See at Best Buy

This incredible price for a 14-inch full-HD Chromebook with a 2.05 GHz processor, integrated graphics, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage is only slightly more than half the price of Apple’s entry-level 10th gen iPad, and the lowest price of the iPad Pro would cover the price of the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 five times over. The original $399 price for the IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is, honestly, reasonable. But Best Buy’s current $169 deal is unbeatable.

Gets It Done

We’re not going to tell you the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is fancy, or jam-packed with incredible features or the very latest bells and whistles. What we can tell you is, it’s abundantly solid, especially for high school or college students. It’s sturdy, it’s durable, it’s easy on the eyes, and it just gets things done.

What kind of things? The stuff you do every single day, like browse, check and send email, post to your social media, and maybe catch up on a little streaming on the clear, full-HD screen. The IdeaPad Slim 3 does all of those things very well, and can do them all day long thanks to the 13.5-hour battery life. And it can do them wherever you need, because the IdeaPad Slim 3 is, indeed, slim and lightweight and abundantly portable.

Connections At the Ready

Again, the IdeaPad Slim 3 isn’t going to blow you away with a massive array of ports to become the hub of a huge desktop setup, but it has what you need — one USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, a microSD card reader, and a headphone/microphone aux jack. It will run an external monitor just fine, and an external SSD to augment the 64GB of built-in storage is also easy to conn"

But, in this new clip from the upcoming home release of Thunderbolts, you’ll realize it’s also a place to really push the boundaries of filmmaking.

Thunderbolts, or The New Avengers if you’d like, is the latest film from Marvel Studios, for a few more weeks at least. It stars Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, and Wyatt Russell as the latest, but probably not greatest, superhero team in the MCU. They’re also joined by Lewis Pullman as a character named Bob. Bob is also Sentry, quite possibly the fastest, strongest superhero there is. Unfortunately, that also comes with access to the Void, an evil holding place where Bob can pry into your deepest, darkest fears. It’s the setting of the film’s big finale, and in this exclusive clip from the digital release on July 1, you can see how it all came together.

That clip is just part one of the three behind-the-scenes featurettes on the digital release, which also includes two deleted scenes, a gag reel, and director’s commentary. Here’s the full list, as per the press release:

"UGREEN M4 Mac Mini Dock Costs Peanuts for Early Prime Day, Adds 8TB and 10 Ports to Your Apple Mini PC",Get more out of your Mac Mini M4 with this amazing Ugreen Dock at 34% off.,https://gizmodo.com/ugreen-m4-mac-mini-dock-costs-peanuts-for-early-prime-day-adds-8tb-and-10-ports-to-your-apple-mini-pc-2000621980,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/ugreen-deal.jpg,Technology,"If you pick up a Mac Mini for yourself, then it might feel like you’ve got everything you need. After all, it’s such a dinky little device, and it houses so much power already, so what else is there? That’s all good and well, but at some point, you may start to want a bit more. Your options at that point often boil down to just having to buy a new one, and that’s a pricey proposition. You don’t have to just do that though, you can actually get an upgrade or two for it.

See at Amazon

A great example of this is the Ugreen Mac Mini M4 Dock, which adds a fair amount of utility and is currently just $66. That’s 34% off the usual price of $100. We do recommend grabbing this one as quickly as you can though, as it’s a limited-time deal on Amazon, which basically means it’s not going to last very long at all.

More Mac For Your Mac Mini

This little device essentially serves as a dock for your Mac Mini M4, but also as an all-in-one upgrade. From a physical standpoint, it has anti-slip features underneath it to make sure that your little Mac stays safe when it’s in it, but it’s also just riddled with all sorts of ports that will allow your Mac Mini to last longer than it normally would.

It has a 4K240Hz port to allow you to output to an extra monitor, which is amazing if you’re in need of more digital space, or you’re just someone who finds themselves with a distraction on one screen, while they work on the other. It also has multiple USB ports, data ports, SD ports and more. It is a simple way to connect more things to your Mac Mini, while also allowing the device to do more.

One of its best features though, is that it supports M.2 NVMe SSDs of up to 8TB. This is an incredible way to add more storage to your Mac Mini if you’re looking to do so, all you need to do is pick your preferred SSD for it.

All-in-all, this little dock can do a lot of good work, and it’s a great option for people who own the Mac Mini M4. It’s only going to $66 for a little while longer though, s"

Prime Day 2025 is coming soon on July 8-11, but you don't have to wait to grab good tech deals — and that goes for everyone, not just Prime members. Early deals have already started popping up on Amazon, and one of the best at the moment is on an Engadget-approved air purifier. The Levoit Core 400S air purifier is on sale for $183, which is $37 off its usual price and not too far off of the lowest price we've seen. It's part of a larger sale on all kinds of Levoit devices including other air purifiers, cordless vacuums and more.

The Levoit Core 400S is our current pick for the best air purifier overall. Sure, it might not have the prettiest design of all the options we have tested and the companion app might have a little too much going on. But the Core 400S does its job and does it well.

This smart air purifier is slated to clean the atmosphere in spaces of up to 1,733 square feet in as little as one hour. The Core 400S has a cylindrical shape with vents at the top and a touch display that shows air quality readings. You'll be able to get a sense of the current air quality in your space at a glance with a color-changing ring that will light up in blue, green, orange or red. The 360-degree filtration system is said to be capable of capturing over 99.9 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns, such as dust, pet dander and pollen.

There is an auto mode that should suffice for maintaining air quality, but the Core 400S is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant voice controls too. The fan isn't too loud, even when it's operating at maximum speed — the volume topped out at 62dB in our testing. Meanwhile, at $50 each, the air filter replacements aren't too expensive compared with those from many of Levoit's competitors.

That's what happened with The Martian, which was a delightfully nerdy self-published novel that was transformed into a thrilling film adaptation — thanks to Drew Goddard's script and Ridley Scott's bold direction. And I have a feeling the same will be true for the latest Weir adaptation, Project Hail Mary, judging from the first trailer released today.

It's got everything: Ryan Gosling being funny-yet-heroic, snappy dialog thanks to another Goddard script and directors Philip Lord and Chris Miller (The Lego Movie, 21 Jump Street) out to prove their genius yet again with another seemingly impossible adaptation. What more could you ask for in a space epic?

On the surface, Project Hail Mary bares a resemblance to Danny Boyle's under-loved Sunshine: Stars are dying, and humanity is scrambling for a way to save itself. But in this case, instead of a team of astronauts, Ryan Gosling's school teacher Ryland Grace is our only savior. Bad news for us: he's just getting up from years in a coma, and is also suffering from amnesia. The trailer makes it clear this will be an intergalactic adventure with plenty of surprises (and at least one plot element that wasn't in The Martian)."

Amazon's Prime Day is fast approaching and the early deals are coming through thick and fast. One that is perhaps worth your attention is a discount on Apple's USB-C AirPods Max. The headphones have dropped to $480 , which is a $69 discount. The deal is available for all AirPods Max colorways except purple (sorry if you were holding out for a good deal on that variant!).

This isn't the best price we've ever seen for the AirPods Max. They dipped to $450 during last year's Black Friday period. Still, it's a solid discount for anyone looking to pick up a pair now.

Apple finally refreshed the AirPods Max with a USB-C charging port and new colorways last fall. Earlier this year, the company updated the headphones with some new features, but only for the USB-C model. That version of the AirPods Max now supports lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio , though only in wired mode.

That update and the switch to USB-C charging are the only major changes Apple has made to the AirPods Max, which still otherwise use hardware from 2020 . Even so, the headphones deliver high-quality audio with good active noise cancellation.

We gave the original version of the headphones a score of 84 in our review back in 2020. At the time, the lack of high-res music streaming was one of our main misgivings, but that has since been resolved. Another major negative for us was the price, though this offer mitigates that issue.

Sterilizing Baby Bottles Is a Waste of Time. Here's Why You Should Stop,You might not need to sterilize your baby's bottle as often as you think.,https://www.cnet.com/health/parenting/sterilizing-baby-bottles-is-a-waste-of-time/#ftag=CADf328eec,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/6880edb725e85b8d1feebc103f8c1240c5099c3d/hub/2022/05/13/8c68fa27-5603-4689-b7d7-ab0fdbf9f389/gettyimages-76549375.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=614&width=1092,Technology,"Newborns are a true bundle of joy. They look so cute, and all they do is eat, sleep and poop. But they're also at their most vulnerable growth stage, which makes it essential for caregivers to understand the baby's needs. Part of that is keeping everything clean.

Newborns have a developing immune system, which has led people to believe that sterilizing baby bottles, pacifiers and other items is necessary to protect them from germs and infections. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommends sterilization early on; as your baby grows, it becomes unnecessary. This guide is to help you understand when you should sterilize a baby bottle and when that process can stop.

Based on a recent Reddit thread on the topic, one of the most asked questions from new parents is how often you should sterilize your baby's bottles. Some parents base the answer on whether the baby finishes the bottle, while others say they only sterilize once before switching to regular washing. Regardless of method, the concern is the same: keeping their newborn safe.

We've got even more helpful tips for parents who are running low on baby formula or need suggestions for breast pumps or baby registry must-haves. We also have top picks for the best diapers, baby monitors, car seats and baby clothes.

Why is it important to sterilize baby bottles?

Babies under three months old are still developing their immune system, and many infections that would be more mild or moderate at older ages can be severe in these months. While cleaning bottles thoroughly and immediately using them is usually enough to remove harmful bacteria, viruses and other contaminants, for the first three months of a baby's life, sterilizing bottles daily or more often is another recommended level of protection.

It's been a wildly popular purchase, and as you might imagine, finding one can be a challenge. But it's not impossible -- which is where we come in. The new gaming console saw the highest global sales of any Nintendo device in its first four days, and every restock we've seen has consistently sold out fast, but fortunately, we are keeping an eye out to help you find a Switch 2 restock.

If you missed preorders and didn't get to a release event, trying to get your hands on one will be a struggle. That's why our dedicated shopping team is scouring the web for any availability, whether online or in-store, and bringing you all the latest updates. We've rounded up everything you need to know about current stocks below, and we'll continue to update this page regularly in the coming days, so be sure to check back often.

Rolling restocks are expected, but the consoles sell out within minutes. That's why we're here to give you the latest info and to make sure you're ready if you're hoping to score one. We're also keeping track of the accessories you'll want for your new console, from screen protectors to cameras and beyond.

Currently, your best chance of getting a Switch 2 right away is visiting a store in person. That said, some retailers have warned that limited stock remains. Currently, Costco has the console listed as available, but remember that you'll have to be a member to shop. GameStop's website also confirms restocks have arrived in-store, so it's worth checking locally. If you're looking to buy internationally, you'll have better luck. Both Canada and the UK have stock at various retailers right now. We've got details below.

Hate the leaked Nothing Phone 3 design? These new leaks are bad news for you,The misaligned triple-camera setup and the chaotic and busy back design gets corroborated in new leaked images.,https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-phone-3-headphone-1-leaked-images-3572360/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Nothing-Phone-3-Leaked-renders.jpg,Technology,"TL;DR New leaked images add weight to the previously leaked renders of the Nothing Headphone 1 and Nothing Phone 3.

In these leaked images, the Nothing Headphone 1 appears once again with its retro-futuristic cassette-inspired look.

Meanwhile, the images for the Nothing Phone 3 indicate we might have to make our peace with the asymmetric and misaligned rear camera setup and the busy back panel.

Nothing is set to launch the Nothing Phone 3 and the Nothing Headphone 1 tomorrow, July 1. Ahead of the launch, more leaks have emerged, showing off marketing renders, but more importantly, confirming that the previously leaked Phone 3 renders might just have been on point.

Reddit user _nilkin_ has shared an image of the Nothing Phone 3 and the Nothing Headphone 1. This appears to be a photo taken of the headphones’ feature sheet, and in it, we can spot both the headphones and the Phone 3.

The leaked promo content mentions a few Nothing Headphone 1 features: Clear Voice technology, On Head Detection, and support for both Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair.

X user @007_mrnitin has shared a better look at the Phone 3 and Headphone 1 combo:

In the image above, you can notice the periscope zoom camera that Nothing has already confirmed for the Phone 3. Perhaps a bit of a stretch, but there also appears to be a semicircle-shaped LED strip between the periscope zoom camera and the Glyph Matrix module, unless I am over-reading the design element.

These images corroborate that at least one set of previously leaked renders for the Phone 3 could be correct. The first set of leaked Phone 3 renders are looking more and more likely to be incorrect — those may very well be for a Phone 3a prototype instead. Because of the bamboozle, Nothing fans have treated the new renders skeptically too (as one should with all leaks), with many deeming the off-centered camera design “fake,” especially since the new renders did not include a periscope zoom lens (characterized by its rectang"

However, Android Headlines posted apparent Nothing Phone 3 renders last week (seen above), and it certainly seems to have drawn a polarizing response online. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that the sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative, with people calling it “ugly” and “awful.” One Redditor even called it an “abomination.”

That's why my air fryer has become my warm-weather kitchen MVP. It cooks up crispy, satisfying meals in minutes without turning my kitchen into a sauna. From midday snacks to full-on dinners, it saves time, keeps things cool and makes cleanup way easier than traditional cooking.

Sure, not every food is an air fryer slam dunk. But when you find the right ones? Total game changer. Think crispy outsides, tender insides and way less oil than deep frying. If your air fryer's been collecting dust or only gets pulled out for frozen fries, now's the perfect time to explore its capabilities. These crowd-pleasing recipes might just earn it a permanent spot on your counter, too.

Though fries and wings are the go-to air fryer staples, these powerhouse appliances can handle much more diverse ingredients. From whole-roasted chicken and flaky salmon to seasonal vegetables like asparagus and spring carrots, air fryers will get you excellent results with minimal effort. But there are certain foods that feel like they were practically made to cook in an air fryer. You'll find a ton of Reddit threads with home cooks asking for the ultimate air fryer recipes, and we've put together this guide to help you out with our favorites.

If you're searching for an air fryer or to upgrade your existing oven, we have a new favorite model with a glass cooking chamber that's easy to clean and doubles as a food storage container.

I always install Chrome Beta on all my Android phones; here’s why,Having two completely separate Chrome apps means I control my personal and work accounts and data.,https://www.androidauthority.com/always-install-chrome-beta-android-phones-3572337/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-chrome-multiple-accounts-4.jpg,Technology,"Rita El Khoury / Android Authority

It’s been more than 13 years since Chrome first launched on Android. Fundamentally, the app hasn’t changed much in all these years: I type a URL and the page loads up. In all these years, though, Chrome hasn’t caught up with the rest of Google’s apps in one key feature: multiple account support.

Most of the official Google apps let me quickly switch between different Google accounts, and they have done that for many years now, since 2010-2011, to be precise. Chrome, however, doesn’t allow that for some reason, and it’s the bane of my existence. To fix that, I always install Chrome Beta (and Chrome Dev) on my Android phones. Here’s why and how I make it work for me.

Do you use Chrome Beta, Dev, or Canary to create two separate browsing sessions or profiles? 65 votes Yes. 14 % I used to, but I no longer need this. 5 % I had no idea this can be done! I'll do it now. 15 % No, I have no need for this. 45 % No, I don't use Chrome at all. 22 %

What Chrome Beta allows me to do that Chrome stable doesn’t

Rita El Khoury / Android Authority

I’m probably not the only person to have multiple Google accounts. Many people have at least two — personal and work/school — and potentially more for other purposes. For me, there’s a personal one, a work one for Android Authority, and a joint one with my husband, which we use for all the shared bills, reservations, documents, and purchases.

Since the beginning, I’ve established a clear separation between these three accounts. I don’t link them together inside the same Chrome profile on my desktop computer; instead, I use separate Chrome profiles that allow me to keep church and state private. That way, my work browsing doesn’t affect my personal recommendations, and my personal data doesn’t leak into work or my shared joint account.

Bookmarks, browsing history, cookies, caches, default addresses and payment methods, saved logins and passwords — all of these are separate between each account and p"

It’s also the most turbulent moment in the US Copyright Office’s history. Described as “sleepy” in the past, the Copyright Office has taken on new prominence during the AI boom, issuing key rulings about AI and copyright. It also hasn’t had a leader in more than a month.

In May, Copyright Register Shira Perlmutter was abruptly fired by email by the White House’s deputy director of personnel. Perlmutter is now suing the Trump administration, alleging that her firing was invalid; the government maintains that the executive branch has the authority to dismiss her. As the legality of the ouster is debated, the reality within the office is this: There’s effectively nobody in charge. And without a leader actually showing up at work, the Copyright Office is not totally business-as-usual; in fact, there’s debate over whether the copyright certificates it’s issuing could be challenged.

The firing followed a pattern. The USCO is part of the Library of Congress; Perlmutter had been appointed to her role by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. A few days before Perlmutter’s dismissal, Hayden, who had been in her role since 2016, was also fired by the White House via email. The White House appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who had previously served as President Trump’s defense attorney, as the new acting Librarian of Congress.

Two days after Pelmutter’s firing, Justice Department official Paul Perkins showed up at the Copyright Office, along with his colleague Brian Nieves. According to an affidavit from Perlmutter, they were carrying “printed versions of emails” from Blanche indicating that they had been appointed to new roles within the Copyright Office. Perkins, the email said, was designated as Acting Register of Copyrights. In other words, he was Perlmutter’s replacement."
A neural brain implant provides near instantaneous speech,Focusing on sound production instead of word choice makes for a flexible system.,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-neural-brain-implant-provides-near-instantaneous-speech/,Ars Technica,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Photo-BCI-participant-is-being-connected-to-the-BCI-system-by-researcher-Iacobacci-1152x648.jpg,Technology,"Stephen Hawking, a British physicist and arguably the most famous man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), communicated with the world using a sensor installed in his glasses. That sensor used tiny movements of a single muscle in his cheek to select characters on a screen. Once he typed a full sentence at a rate of roughly one word per minute, the text was synthesized into speech by a DECtalk TC01 synthesizer, which gave him his iconic, robotic voice.

But a lot has changed since Hawking died in 2018. Recent brain-computer-interface (BCI) devices have made it possible to translate neural activity directly into text and even speech. Unfortunately, these systems had significant latency, often limiting the user to a predefined vocabulary, and they did not handle nuances of spoken language like pitch or prosody. Now, a team of scientists at the University of California, Davis has built a neural prosthesis that can instantly translate brain signals into sounds—phonemes and words. It may be the first real step we have taken toward a fully digital vocal tract.

Text messaging

“Our main goal is creating a flexible speech neuroprosthesis that enables a patient with paralysis to speak as fluently as possible, managing their own cadence, and be more expressive by letting them modulate their intonation,” says Maitreyee Wairagkar, a neuroprosthetics researcher at UC Davis who led the study. Developing a prosthesis ticking all these boxes was an enormous challenge because it meant Wairagkar’s team had to solve nearly all the problems BCI-based communication solutions have faced in the past. And they had quite a lot of problems.

The first issue was moving beyond text—most successful neural prostheses developed so far have translated brain signals into text—the words a patient with an implanted prosthesis wanted to say simply appeared on a screen. Francis R. Willett led a team at Stanford University that achieved brain-to-text translation with around a 25 percent e"
Ars reflects on Apollo 13 turning 30,Ron Howard's 1995 love letter to NASA's Apollo program takes a few historical liberties but it still inspires awe.,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ars-reflects-on-apollo-13-turning-30/,Ars Technica,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/apollo12-1152x648.jpg,Technology,"This year marks the 30th anniversary of the 1995 Oscar-winning film, Apollo 13, director Ron Howard's masterful love letter to NASA's Apollo program in general and the eponymous space mission in particular. So we're taking the opportunity to revisit this riveting homage to American science, ingenuity, and daring.

(Spoilers below.)

Apollo 13 is a fictional retelling of the aborted 1970 lunar mission that became a ""successful failure"" for NASA because all three astronauts made it back to Earth alive against some pretty steep odds. The film opens with astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) hosting a watch party in July 1969 for Neil Armstrong's historic first walk on the Moon. He is slated to command the Apollo 14 mission, and is ecstatic when he and his crew—Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton)—are bumped to Apollo 13 instead. His wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) is more superstitious and hence less thrilled: ""It had to be 13."" To which her pragmatic husband replies, ""It comes after 12.""

A few days before launch, Mattingly is grounded because he was exposed to the measles and replaced with backup Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), who is the only one happy about the situation. But Lovell and Haise rebound from the disappointment and the launch goes off without a hitch. The public, alas, just isn't interested in what they think has become routine. But the mission is about to become anything but that.

During a maintenance task to stir the oxygen tanks, an electrical short causes one of the tanks to explode, with the other rapidly venting its oxygen into space. The crew has less than an hour to evacuate the command module Odyssey into the lunar module Aquarius, using it as a lifeboat. There is no longer any chance of landing on the Moon; the new mission is to keep the astronauts alive long enough to figure out how to bring them safely home. That means overcoming interpersonal tensions, freezing conditions, dwindling rations, and unhealthy CO2 levels, among oth"
Android 16 review: Post-hype,"The age of big, exciting Android updates is probably over.",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/,Ars Technica,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Android-16-1-1152x648.jpg,Technology,"Google recently released Android 16, which brings a smattering of new features for Pixel phones, with promises of additional updates down the road. The numbering scheme has not been consistent over the years, and as a result, Android 16 is actually the 36th major release in a lineage that stretches back nearly two decades. In 2008, we didn't fully understand how smartphones would work, so there was a lot of trial and error. In 2025, the formula has been explored every which way. Today's smartphones run mature software, and that means less innovation in each yearly release. That trend is exemplified and amplified by Google's approach to Android 16.

The latest release is perhaps the most humdrum version of the platform yet, but don't weep for Google. The company has been working toward this goal for years: a world where the average phone buyer doesn't need to worry about Android version numbers.

A little fun up front

When you install Android 16 on one of Google's Pixel phones, you may need to check the settings to convince yourself that the update succeeded. Visually, the changes are so minuscule that you'll only notice them if you're obsessive about how Android works. For example, Google changed the style of icons in the overview screen and added a few more options to the overview app menus. There are a lot of these minor style tweaks; we expect more when Google releases Material 3 Expressive, but that's still some way off.

There are some thoughtful UI changes, but again, they're very minor and you may not even notice them at first. For instance, Google's predictive back gesture, which allows the previous screen to peek out from behind the currently displayed one, now works with button navigation.

Apps targeting the new API (level 36) will now default to using edge-to-edge rendering, which removes the navigation background to make apps more immersive. Android apps have long neglected larger form factors because Google itself was neglecting those devices. Since t"
The second launch of New Glenn will aim for Mars,The payload likely to spark the most interest is the Blue Moon MK1 lander.,https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/the-second-launch-of-new-glenn-will-aim-for-mars/,Ars Technica,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/New-Glenn-1-1152x648.jpg,Technology,"Blue Origin is making steady progress toward the second launch of its New Glenn rocket, which could occur sometime this fall.

The company already ignited the second stage of this rocket, in a pre-launch test, in April. And two sources say the first stage for this launch is in the final stages of preparation at the company's facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Publicly, the company has said this second launch will take place no earlier than August 15. This is now off the table. One source told Ars that a mid- to late-September launch date was ""realistic,"" but another person said late October or November was more likely.

Blue Origin has been mum about the payload that will fly on this rocket, but multiple people have told Ars that the current plan is to launch NASA's ESCAPADE mission on the second launch of New Glenn. This mission encompasses a pair of small spacecraft that will be sent to Mars to study the red planet's magnetosphere.

Who’s on first

This Mars mission was originally supposed to be on New Glenn's first flight in October 2024 but was taken off that flight due to uncertainty in the debut launch date. The issue was that once the two spacecraft were fueled with hypergolic propellant, they needed to be launched within a certain time period.

Had ESCAPADE launched last October, the spacecraft would now be nearing Mars and beginning scientific operations. However, because they missed the Mars ""window"" last year, they will have to wait for the next one to open late this year. Thus, the nominal plan involves a launch this fall, with the spacecraft now not reaching Mars until later in 2027.

After ESCAPADE, Blue Origin has several missions tentatively plotted out. However, sources cautioned that the manifest could be moved around due to the readiness of subsequent New Glenn vehicles and their payloads.

Based upon information received by Ars, the launch manifest could look something like this:"

If you’ve ever unboxed a new laptop with Windows or macOS you’ll have been greeted by a slick, guided setup to walk you through creating a user account, setting timezone and language, etc.

Most KDE Linux distros handle user-creation stuff through the Calamares installer, with an OEM mode for, well, OEMs to use to delegate setup on first boot. Though serviceable, it’s not as slick as the initial setup on Windows, macOS or even GNOME.

Screenshots of the new setup tool (credit: Kristen McWilliam)

The KDE Initial System Setup tool was created to do things better. Following a stalled start, a renewed effort is underway to build-out the ideas behind KISS, finish the codebase, and improve what it does and the way in which it does it.

End result: users booting into a new KDE-powered machine for the first time get a welcome peppered with KDE’s trademark personality, which is something hardware makers who sell laptops with KDE-based Linux distributions on will appreciate.

People do say first-run, out-of-the-box impressions count—well, they say something like that.

So, what’s new?

A recent update from KDE developer Kristen McWilliam reports on some of the new features and capabilities added to the (hitherto crusty) KISS codebase:

It now runs and compiles (always a good start)

User account creation now works (placeholder GUI previously)

Per McWilliam’s blog post, which also includes a video of it in action, getting the keyboard layout selector implemented wasn’t easy but reusing parts of Plasma’s existing keyboard-related settings helped.

KDE Update Turns Off Potentially Seizure Triggering Effect,"KDE Plasma 6.4.1 turns off a visual desktop effect which could, in rare cases, post a risk of triggering seizures in users with photosensitive conditions.

Now, it’s not like latest KDE desktop was running a disco out of the box, but the ‘highlight window’ effect enabled by default for Task Manager thumbnails might, under a specific workflow, cause enough screen flickering at the frequencies that trigger seizures in susceptible users.

Which is not good (just ask the Pokemon cartoon).

As such, KDE Plasma 6.4.1 turns the ‘highlight window’ effect off by default.

KDE’s Nate Graham, relaying the change, outlines the workflow needed to create consistent full-screen flickering with the effect, noting that though ‘unlikely’ to occur it is ‘not impossible’.

“[U]ntil and unless we can fix the effect to not be so flickery with this specific usage, it’s safer to keep it off. Furthermore, even for people who aren’t photosensitive, it’s currently a really unpleasant visual effect,” he adds.

Similarly, the ‘visual bell’ is now throttled. This change was made because if “too many bell requests are sent too fast there is a risk that the screen flashes repeatedly, causing issues for users with photosensitivity.”

There are some other (less dramatic) fixes in KDE Plasma 6.4.1 including:

Text label contrast improvements to meet WCAG AA

UI adjustments in Discover

Window list widget menu is now working

More fixes will find their way out in to the wild over the coming months, with next point release, KDE Plasma 6.4.2, scheduled to arrive in early July 2025.

It’s likely that we’ll see more fixes that, like the photosensitivity buffs in this update, continue to address, and improve accessibility in KDE Plasma.

Accessibility is about everyone

KDE, like other Linux desktops, is focused on complying with the European Accessibility Act 2025 (EU Directive 2019/882). This requires a wide range of digital products and services to be made accessible to people with differing abilities.

Last month Canonical’s engineers announced plans to change development builds building through greater automated testing and build reproducibility, creating new OS images faster and ‘with little to no human intervention.’

It’s a passive-sounding approach that is technically pragmatic.

New build systems processes and workflow integrations that are transparent, amendable and auditable could mean volunteers spend less time doing menial checks and more time building new things.

It also may mean that major issues that might prove “blockers” to release get found much sooner in the. development cycle. Prior, big issues only tend to be uncovered in the later beta stages of testing when more community volunteers feel comfortable to start testing.

Even so, it’s early days for the new approach. For now, it’s making snapshots and these not production ready. They are not betas. They are not more stable than a regular daily build — and they’re certainly not rolling releases, as some assume!

As Canonical’s Utkarsh Gupta puts it in a mail blast to the Ubuntu Devel mailing list: “We’d like to remind you that these aren’t production ready and should be seen as “throwaway artifacts” for now” (sic).

In a sense, the Ubuntu monthly snapshots are as much about letting distro engineers test, assess and fine-tune the infrastructure backend to produce working OS images as it is about producing a build to test, assess and fine-tine the OS itself.

Or as I originally wrote that sentence: you won’t know if your new automated processes are producing working builds until your new automated processes are producing builds people can say are working ;) .

A Moveable GNOME Top Bar? This Extension Gives You One,"A new GNOME Shell extension that turns the top bar into a compact, movable widget, so you can customise your Ubuntu desktop minimalism in mind.

Ubuntu,https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/floating-mini-panel.jpg?resize=406%2C232&amp;ssl=1,Technology,"GNOME Shell extensions make it easy to remould the standard desktop layout in a myriad of ways, and free up screen estate in the process.

This week, a new add-on arrived on to the scene to aid in those seeking minimalism: Floating Mini Panel.

Floating Mini Panel does what it says: it turns the GNOME Shell Top Bar (the panel across the top of the display) into a compact, movable and always-on-top panel that can be activated as and when needed using a toggle in the Quick Settings menu.

This may be handy if you who want to retain access to settings and see the time whilst also giving more space over to apps without entering full-screen mode.

Floating Mini Panel is a panel that floats

When activated, Mini Floating Panel only displays the clock/date applet and the Quick Settings menu, alongside with a grab handle button that lets you move the mini panel to your preferred location on screen.

You won’t see any other extension icons, tray indicators or other applets in the floating panel. Rather like a media player mini-mode, it’s essentials only.

Click the grab handle to open the applications picker & workspaces overview. From there, the regular full-width top bar is shown, giving you access any other applets, add-ons or tray icons you need (without needing to toggle out of mini panel mode).

As it is ‘always on top’, the mini panel may get in the way of something else on screen at times. You don’t need to exit mini panel mode or move the panel to access them: right-click the handle to hide the mini panel for 5 seconds.

The author of this neat little tool, ~ghi59, explains the reasoning behind its creation:

“Working most of the time with Laptops, every inch of display space is important. Hiding the Main Panel or going into Fullscreen are ways to gain space. But then Intelli-Hide-Features may disturb or Fullscreen has to be toggled.”

“With the Mini Panel nothing of this is needed for working maximized, staying informed about time and system status and having impor"
Rename Audio Devices on Ubuntu with this ‘Simple’ App,"How to easily rename audio devices on Ubuntu with the Simple Wireplumber GUI app. Replace technical audio device names  with descriptive labels.

It isn’t that labels like GF119 HDMI Audio Controller or internal speakers don’t say what they do—they do!—but if switching sound output quickly with similarly-named options it can introduce a minor delay as you scan the list to work out which BT-01 is the tinny Temu bluetooth speaker Santa fly-tipped in your Christmas stocking.

Ubuntu uses Pipewire as its default sound server and Wireplumber as its session and policy manager. This means we have several ways to go about changing audio device names.

The easiest I’ve come across is Simple Wireplumber GUI. It is a user-friendly tool for Wireplumber that lets you rename sound devices (both input and output) to whatever you like, and and see those names reflected throughout the desktop UI, settings and other apps.

You can make sound device labels more descriptive, which makes visual scanning easier and generally keep your sound menus looking tidy and ordered.

Simple Wireplumber GUI

First, you need to install the Simple Wireplumber GUI app. Unless you are content to build it from its source code, you will need to install it from Flathub.

If you haven’t already set up Flathub and Flatpak on Ubuntu, you will need to do that first. When you install the app, it will also pull in the GNOME 48 runtime (a bundle of dependencies that Flatpak apps share).

If you already use Flathub on Ubuntu—and if you don’t, you are missing out on some terrific apps—installing Simple Wireplumber GUI won’t take long at all since it is a modest <400KiB download:

flatpak install flathub io.github.dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui

Before you launch the app, there’s an extra hoop to jump through on Ubuntu (this may apply to other distros too but I only tested on Ubuntu).

Available now in the US and Korea, the first One UI 8 Watch beta is a nearly 2GB update available for the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung notes that only the Bluetooth and T-Mobile LTE models can participate in the beta for now.

What’s new in this update?

Besides a host of health features that Samsung previously announced, you can expect some UI changes throughout the update. Samsung directly says that the Now Bar is expanding to Galaxy Watch alongside “custom tiles” and “watch face customizations.”

Samsung’s changelog says:

One UI 8 Watch makes it even easier to get things done and stay connected from your wrist. New Samsung Health features give you more tools to manage your physical and mental wellness. You also get more ways to personalize with watch face suggestions, custom tiles, and the Now bar.

You can sign up for the One UI 8 Watch beta if you have a compatible Galaxy Watch through the Samsung Members app.

One UI 8 Watch will be the launchpad for Wear OS 6, and is expected to be available out of the box on the Galaxy Watch 8 series.

The new software will offer a few changes, including serious health suite features.

One UI 8 is Samsung’s version of Wear OS 6, and it’s been a long time coming for the Galaxy Watch. The current version of Wear OS for the Galaxy Watch is iteration 5, though it falls under the moniker of One UI 6. The Galaxy Watch series didn’t miss out on any changes; it just skips a software generation in name only to One UI 8.

The update will add a couple of major features to Samsung’s health tracking suite. That includes a new Bedtime Guidance mode that will help you tune your sleep further with actions you can take. A new Vascular Load tool will measure stress on your system during sleep. We’ll also see a Running Coach and Antioxidant Index in the new update.

How to install One UI 8 beta for Galaxy Watch

The first thing to note is which devices will be able to access the One UI 8 Watch beta update. So far, Samsung has noted that these devices will be eligible:

Galaxy Watch 7

Galaxy Watch Ultra

Galaxy Watch FE

Galaxy Watch 6

Galaxy Watch 6 Classic

Galaxy Watch 5

Galaxy Watch 5 Pro

At the time of writing, only the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 7 can install the beta. Later models will soon follow.

Samsung also explicitly mentions users in the US and Korea, with no allusion to Europe or other regions. This might be temporary while the update rolls out, so we’ll have to wait and see how far the beta reaches. Samsung also doesn’t note which devices will get beta access first, so there may be some delay for users with older devices.

To download the One UI 8 Watch beta, you’ll need to have your Galaxy Watch connected to a Samsung device. From there, you’ll need to complete the process in the Samsung Members app.

We’re getting down to the wire, as Samsung’s set to debut final builds for its Android 16-based upgrade at Unpacked next week. Today’s patch isn’t quite as expansive as Beta 2, but it does come with a handful of bug fixes (via SamMobile). Here’s the changelog:

One UI 8 ZYFA Changelog: Fixed the overlap issue between the status bar of the Recents app and the running app menu in specific status of NaviStar

Fixed the issue that the keyboard input occur only when reboots on the Security folder PIN input screen

Improved the issue that intermittently lengthen loading time when entering Mode / Routine menu

Fixed text input (swipe to type) error using gesture on keyboard screen

Fixed text input (S Pen to text) error with S Pen

Added back screen preview to Laboratory

SW stabilization through updates to many apps

Many other improvements

SamMobile also spotted a new feature within Now Brief, Samsung’s marquee Galaxy AI feature first launched earlier this year. The company’s continuing to try and build out its Google Now-esque information feed, and with One UI 8 Beta 3, Now Brief now includes support for birthday alerts. Whenever One UI spots a birthday in your calendar, it’ll prompt you to create an AI-generated card that you can send to your associated contact.

Samsung gives you a handful of typical art options to pick from, including watercolor, sketch, and 3D cartoons. You can use gen-AI prompts to design the card of your choosing, though it also appears that you can add a photo from your own gallery.

Apple marks 10 years of Apple Music with several new announcements

Today as Apple Music turns 10, Apple has announced several ways it’s marking the occasion.

Replay All Time is a brand new playlist that offers a unique spin on the annual Apple Music Replay experience.

With Replay All Time, accessible from the Music app’s Home tab, you’ll see your top played songs from the entire duration you’ve been an Apple Music subscriber. If you joined at the start, that means you’ll see your top music from the past decade.

The new Replay All Time playlist doesn’t yet seem to be live in the Music app, but should be soon.

Apple Music Radio is also revealing the service’s overall top 500 most-streamed songs from the last 10 years.

The countdown will begin Tuesday, July 1 with 100 songs revealed each day, culminating with the top 100 most-streamed debuting on Saturday, July 5.

Apple’s full list of 500 songs will then be available in a new 10 Years of Apple Music: Top Songs playlist.

Live radio was an especially big distinguishing feature of Apple Music when it launched, and to show the continued importance of live hosted radio, Apple’s launching a new LA “global hub for artists.”

This three-story, 15,000-square-foot hub features, per Apple:

Two advanced radio studios with immersive Spatial Audio playback and adaptable setups for live interviews, casual chats, or impromptu performances.

A 4,000-square-foot soundstage for live performances, multicam shoots, fan events, and screenings.

A dedicated Spatial Audio mixing room outfitted with a 9.2.4 PMC speaker system for next-level sound production.

Discover Weekly is an algorithmic playlists that looks at your existing favorite artists, finds other subscribers with the same tastes, and shows you what else they are listening to.

It’s been a highly–successful discovery mechanism for many, and because it is biased to lesser–known artists, it can be a very effective way for emerging artists to find their fan base. Spotify says it’s helped subscribers discover over 100B new tracks, 77% of which are from lesser–known artists.

One area where it can fall short, however, is where your tastes are changing. For example, your own playlists are heavily biased toward indie rock, but you’re now developing a taste for hip–hop. Spotify is now letting premium subscribers steer the discovery process in the right direction, as TechCrunch explains.

Spotify Premium users will see new controls at the top of the playlist, which allow them to push their recommendations toward certain genres. So, if you mostly listen to 80s rock, but you’re starting to develop a soft spot for K-pop, you can select different genre filters to push the algorithmic curation in the right direction […] To access the new-and-improved Discover Weekly, Spotify Premium subscribers can navigate to the “Made for You” hub, then navigate to their Discover Weekly playlist. There, if the latest Spotify version is installed, users will be able to see the new genre controls.

The change is rolling out now, so you may need to update your app to access it – and the controls are only available to paid subscribers.

Early box office results show it’s the company’s biggest theatrical success by far. But while plenty of people might be waiting for it to hit Apple TV+, here’s why F1 The Movie is uniquely worth seeing in theaters.

F1 offers unique theatrical experience that Apple TV+ can’t match

Apple is the iPhone company, a device that—for better or worse—movies and TV shows are commonly viewed on today.

But out of all the movies you might watch on an iPhone, F1 shouldn’t be one of them.

Many people aware of the F1 marketing blitz might think: “It’s an Apple movie, it will release on Apple TV+ eventually. I’ll wait until then.”

Yes, F1 will eventually hit Apple TV+. As my colleague Ben reports, a mid-fall release date is likely.

If you have a huge living room TV and great surround sound setup, F1 will likely be a great at-home experience.

One theme that’s come up constantly in early reviews, though, is that F1 truly deserves a theatrical viewing.

Why? Because the film’s goal of shooting ultra-realistic racing scenes is best achieved on the biggest screen possible—preferably IMAX.

David Chen writes in his newsletter Decoding Everything:

Where the movie really shines are its racing scenes. Pitt and Idris learned how to drive real F2 cars and Kosinski and team developed new camera systems to fit high-quality sensors into the cockpit of those vehicles. The result is a level of immersion one rarely experiences in the theater. It becomes easy to believe that these characters are actually in peril, driving at speeds in defiance of the Lord’s will and trying to dodge other cars and race obstacles along the way…I don’t know how to describe it other than that it’s one of the most impressive IMAX experiences I’ve ever had.

”It’s one of the most impressive IMAX experience I’ve ever had.”

Diving into the details of how F1 was shot helps explain why.

But now the company has confirmed that, due to regulatory concerns, iOS 26 will ship without certain features enabled for EU users.

EU will see delayed release of iOS 26 features due to DMA concerns

Apple’s ongoing efforts to comply with the EU’s DMA will mean EU users will be missing out on certain iOS 26 features…at least for now.

Edith Hancock writes at The Wall Street Journal:

Apple said it will delay offering some planned new features to users in the European Union this year because regulations are making it harder to bring them to market in the region. The company’s lawyers said on Monday that tools such as a “visited places” service that tracks and records where users have been won’t be rolled out in the EU when it releases its iOS 26 software update later this year.

“Visited places” is one of the new features being brought to Apple Maps in iOS 26. It’s also the kind of feature that seems like a precursor to some helpful Apple Intelligence capabilities.

Though this Maps feature is the only one currently cited by Apple as definitely not making the cut for iOS 26’s fall launch, it sounds like other features could be delayed in the EU too.

Hancock writes: ”Apple said it is still analyzing features that may not be available in the EU and working to find solutions to deliver features as quickly as possible.”

Here’s Apple’s official statement:

“We’ve already had to make the decision to delay the release of products and features, we announced this month for our EU customers,” Kyle Andeer, Vice President, Apple Legal, told a workshop with EU officials and developers in Brussels. Users’ security could be compromised if the company is obliged to open up its ecosystem to competitors, Andeer said.

EU users have grown used to missing out on certain iOS features ever since last year.

""There are still keywords to look for depending on a person’s skin type,"" she adds. ""If a person’s skin is dry, look for sunscreens that have moisturizing ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid. For oily skin, look for the words 'oil-free' or 'noncomedogenic.' These sunscreens are less likely to clog pores and cause outbreaks. Mineral sunscreens are less irritating to people with sensitive skin. They should also avoid sunscreens with added fragrances.""

If you have oily or acne-prone skin, sensitive skin or dry skin on your face, the best sunscreen for your face and particular needs exists -- and may even be on this list. Many of these formulas are from higher-end skincare brands, with a few drugstore finds. We're not saying you need to buy the more expensive options, but if you do, you'll usually get a better formula that caters to your skin type, feels lightweight and blends well.

Dry skin: Use sunscreens that contain moisturizing ingredients including aloe, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, coconut water, sunflower oil or various fruit extracts. The sunscreen can be added on top of moisturizer or on its own, depending on how dry your skin is.

Oily skin: Steer clear of any sunscreen that is not oil-free. You don't want to add to the overall oil. Look for sunscreens that say ""noncomedogenic"" on the bottle, meaning it won't clog pores.

Acne-prone skin: If you have oily skin, chances are you also have acne-prone skin. Similarly, pick sunscreens that are noncomedogenic, oil-free, fragrance-free, paraben-free and irritation-free.

Sensitive skin: Look for sunscreens that have minimal ingredients and that are first and foremost, fragrance-free. It also helps if the sunscreen is dermatologist-tested, oil-free, paraben-free, irritation-free and noncomedogenic.

Whether you use mineral sunscreen formulations or chemical ones, be sure you use one with broad spectrum SPF and skin-nurturi"

These coniferous trees are known in European folklore as a symbol of death and doom.

They’re anything but. The Pacific yew naturally synthesizes paclitaxel—commonly known as Taxol, a chemotherapy drug widely used to fight multiple types of aggressive cancer. In the late 1990s, it was FDA-approved for breast, ovarian, and lung cancer and, since then, has been used off-label for roughly a dozen other malignancies. It’s a modern success story showing how we can translate plant biology into therapeutic drugs.

But because Taxol is produced in the tree’s bark, harvesting the life-saving chemical kills its host. Yew trees are slow-growing with very long lives, making them an unsustainable resource. If scientists can unravel the genetic recipe for Taxol, they can recreate the steps in other plants—or even in yeast or bacteria—to synthesize the molecule at scale without harming the trees.

A new study in Nature takes us closer to that goal. Taxol is made from a precursor chemical, called baccatin III, which is just a few chemical steps removed from the final product and is produced in yew needles. After analyzing thousands of yew tree cells, the team mapped a 17-gene pathway leading to the production of baccatin III.

They added these genes to tobacco plants—which don’t naturally produce baccatin III—and found the plants readily pumped out the chemical at similar levels to yew tree needles.

The results are “a breakthrough in our understanding of the genes responsible for the biological production of this drug,” wrote Jakob Franke at Leibniz University Hannover, who was not involved in the study. “The findings are a major leap forward in efforts to secure a reliable supply of paclitaxel.”

Wimbledon's hottest opening day sees players deal with sweltering conditions,"Players, staff and spectators contend with sweltering conditions as Wimbledon records the hottest opening day in the tournament's history.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c8e44r1g9lko,BBC Sport,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c4e5/live/b2fa32d0-55ad-11f0-a13f-c72f3e976a79.jpg,Sports,"Players, ground staff and spectators had to contend with sweltering conditions as Wimbledon recorded its hottest opening day on record.

Air temperature on the grounds had reached 31.4C by 14:00 BST on Monday, surpassing the previous record at the start of a Championships - the 29.3C set in 2001.

However, the tournament's extreme heat rule, which allows players a 10-minute break, has not yet been enforced because Wimbledon measures additional factors to determine heat stress.

Players were given ice packs, cold towels and plenty of water to help regulate their temperature during changeovers.

The boy balls and girls were also given cooling scarves, while spectators attempted to shade themselves with hats, umbrellas and even towels, and others cooled themselves with hand-held fans.

The hottest temperature ever recorded during the tournament remains the 35.7C reached in 2015.

Temperatures are again forecast to return to the mid-30s on Tuesday.

Wimbledon organisers use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) heat index, which combines air temperature, humidity and surface temperature readings, to determine when the heat rule should be enforced.

The 10-minute breaks are allowed after the secon.d set for all best-of-three set matches, and after the third for all best-of-five set matches, with players permitted to leave the court during the interval.

Britain's Sonay Kartal, speaking after her opening three-set win over Jelena Ostapenko, said: ""I'm not going to lie, it was pretty hot. I think I made a bit of a rookie mistake not changing clothes at the end of the first set.

""It was hot, but I had ice towels, cold drinks and stuff. I wouldn't say it affected me too much. It was nice to play in no wind, no rain. I think it's a good first day."""

""Speculation to the contrary is simply inaccurate,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.

But the Trump Mobile organisation says the phone will still be made in America.

A ""Made in the USA"" tagline featured in promotional material for the Trump T1 phone when it launched on 16 June, was no longer displayed on its site as of Wednesday, reporters found.

Days after the Trump Organization announced plans to launch a US-made smartphone, a reference to its American production has vanished from its website.

""We're excited to launch the phones later this year, but in the meantime, anyone can switch to Trump Mobile now with their current phones,"" they added - directing people to the provider's website to find out more.

Wording on the company's website, advertising the launch of its upcoming mobile plan for Americans, now counts an ""American-Proud Design"" among the Trump T1 phone's key features.

They also say the phone is ""brought to life right here in the USA"", with ""American hands behind every device"".

A banner that previously encouraged site visitors to pre-order ""our MADE IN THE USA T1 Phone"" on the website now only refers to it as ""the new T1 phone"".

The changes were first spotted by tech news publisher, The Verge.

When the gold Trump smartphone was announced by family members of president Donald Trump, experts cast doubt on the idea it could currently be built from scratch in the US.

""They don't even have a working prototype. It's extremely unlikely,"" said Prof Tinglong Dai of Johns Hopkins' Carey Business School.

""You would have to have a miracle,"" he added.

CCS Insight analyst Leo Gebbie said the US ""simply does not have the high-tech supply chain"" required for smartphone assembly - especially not in time for its slated release in September.

He said that assembling the phone in the US from parts imported from elsewhere may be the ""most likely"" path for claiming its American sovereignty.

She is talking about her girlfriend Vivianne Miedema, the Netherlands and Manchester City forward, and the fact the Lionesses have been drawn against the Dutch in group D at the European Championship in Switzerland.

The tournament kicks off on Wednesday and the couple are set to face each other in Zurich on 9 July, with the match shown live on the BBC.

""We're both very, very competitive and professional. We're both excited for the tournament and to be able to play in it again,"" Arsenal forward Mead added.

The couple, who have been in a relationship since 2022, have each enjoyed Euros success, with Miedema winning it in 2017 and Mead five years later.

They both missed the 2023 World Cup after suffering anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries within a month of each other at the end of 2022.

Both have battled back to full fitness for Euro 2025. They regularly communicate with one another but football chat is strictly limited.

""We keep in contact but when it gets closer to our games, we don't talk football whatsoever,"" Mead adds.

""Obviously we want each other to do well but not against each other!""

One subject they do talk a lot about is their dog Myle, whom they welcomed into their family when they were recovering from their ACL injuries.

Mead has been fortunate as Myle (pronounced My-lee) was allowed to stay with her during England's preparations at St George's Park.

Cameroon international Mbeumo is the subject of serious interest from Manchester United, who have had two offers for the striker rejected - the second of which was worth up to £62.5m.

Mbeumo, 25, wants to join United and is understood to have told the west London club that.

Speaking on Monday, Giles told BBC Sport there had been ""not so much"" progress regarding a potential deal.

""He had a fantastic season,"" he said. ""We expected big interest in him, we have had big interest in him.

""He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career. He is well within his rights to do that.

""It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.""

Giles said Mbeumo would only be sold if it was ""the right deal"" for Brentford.

""Any club will tell you that,"" he added. ""If it's not right deal, why would we do it?

""He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There's no harm in keeping your best players.""

Meanwhile, Giles also confirmed captain Christian Norgaard was close to joining Arsenal.

BBC Sport revealed last week the two Premier League clubs had agreed a fee - believed to be up to £15m inclusive of add-ons - for the Denmark midfielder.

""We have been in conversations with Arsenal for the last week to 10 days,"" said Giles. ""As it stands it hasn't been completed yet but it is heading in that direction.

Businesses are selling Foxconn the goods and services it needs to make iPhones, including tiny parts, assembly-line equipment and worker recruitment.

Some of the firms are Indian; others are Taiwanese, South Korean or American. Some were already in the area, while others are setting up in India for the first time.

The changes spurred by Foxconn are rippling broadly through Bengaluru, a city of eight million people that had a start in the 20th century as home to India’s first aerospace centers. But its manufacturing base was pushed aside, first by call centers and then by flashier work in microchip design and outsourced professional services. Going back to the factory floor, as they’re doing in Devanahalli, is what Mr. Trump wants American workers to do.

To see the changes afoot here is to understand the allure of bringing back manufacturing. Wages are rising 10 to 15 percent around the Foxconn plant. Businesses are quietly making deals to supply Foxconn and Apple’s other contractors."

The couple have been “narrowing their ambition, changing their priorities, stringing people along,” she said. “It has been death by a thousand cuts.”

Cancer-Killing Immune Cells Can Now Be Engineered in the Body—With a Vaccine-Like Shot of mRNA,"Scientists are converting immune cells into super-soldiers that can hunt down and destroy cancer cells.

Scientists extract a patient’s own immune cells, genetically engineer them to target a specific type of cancer, and infuse the boosted cells back into the body to hunt down their prey.

Six therapies have been approved by the FDA for multiple types of blood cancer. Hundreds of other clinical trials are in the works to broaden the immunotherapy’s scope. These include trials aimed at recurrent cancers and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and systemic sclerosis, in which the body’s immune system destroys its own organs.

But making CAR T cells is a long and expensive process. It requires genetic tinkering in the lab, and patients need to have mutated blood cells wiped out with chemotherapy to make room for healthy new ones. While effective, the treatment takes a massive toll on the body and mind.

It would be faster and potentially more effective to make CAR T cells inside the body. Previous studies have tried to shuttle genes that would do just that into immune cells using viruses or fatty bubbles. But these tend to accumulate in the liver rather than target cells. The approach could also result in hyper-aggressive cells that spark life-threatening immune responses.

Inspired by Covid-19 vaccines, a new study tried shuttling a different kind of gene expression into the body. Instead of gene editors, the method turned to mRNA, a biomolecule that translates DNA instructions into cellular functions. The new method is now more targeted—skipping the liver and heading straight to immune cells—and doesn’t change a cell’s DNA blueprint, potentially making it safer than previous approaches. In rodents and monkeys, a few jabs converted T cells to CAR T cells within hours, and these went on to kill cancer cells. The effects “reset” the animals’ immune systems and lasted for roughly a month with few side effects.

Now, it’s starting to pay that effort back by accelerating progress across academia.

Ever since the emergence of AI as a field of study, researchers have dreamed of creating tools smart enough to accelerate humanity’s endless drive to acquire new knowledge. With the advent of deep learning in the 2010s, this goal finally became a realistic possibility.

Between 2012 and 2022, the proportion of scientific papers that have relied on AI in some way has quadrupled to almost 9 percent. Researchers are using neural networks to analyze data, conduct literature reviews, or model complex processes across every scientific discipline. And as the technology advances, the scope of problems they can tackle is expanding by the day.

The poster boy for AI’s use in science is undoubtedly Google DeepMind’s Alphafold, whose inventors won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The model used advances in transformers—the architecture that powers large language models—to solve the “protein folding problem” that had bedeviled scientists for decades.

A protein’s structure determines its function, but previously the only way to discover its shape was with complex imaging techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Alphafold, in comparison, could predict the shape of a protein from nothing more than the series of amino acids making it up, something computer scientists had been trying and failing to do for years.

This made it possible to predict the shape of every protein known to science in just two years, a feat that could have transformative impact on biomedical research. Alphafold 3, released in 2024, goes even further. It can predict both the structure and interactions of proteins, as well as DNA, RNA, and other biomolecules.

Google has also turned its AI loose on another area of the life sciences, working with Harvard researchers to create the most detailed map of human bra"

Its delicate interior is completely surrounded by a protective wall called the blood-brain barrier.

True to its name, the barrier separates contents in the blood and the brain. It keeps bacteria and other pathogens in the blood away from delicate brain tissue, while allowing oxygen and some nutrients to flow through.

The protection comes at a cost: Some medications, made up of large molecules, can’t enter the brain. These include antibodies that block the formation of protein clumps in Alzheimer’s disease, immunotherapies that destroy deadly brain tumors, and missing enzymes that could rescue inherited developmental diseases.

For decades, scientists have tried to smuggle these larger drugs into the brain without damaging the barrier. Now, thanks to a new crop of molecular shuttles, they’re on the brink of success. A top contender is based on transferrin, a protein that supplies iron to the brain—an element needed for myriad critical chemical reactions to ensure healthy brain function.

Although still in its infancy, the shuttle has already changed lives. One example is Hunter syndrome, a rare and incurable genetic disease in which brain cells lack a crucial enzyme. Kids with the syndrome begin losing their language, hearing, and movement as young toddlers. In severe cases, their lives are tragically cut short at 10 to 20 years of age.

Early results in clinical trials using the transferrin shuttle are showing promise. After delivering the missing enzyme into the brains of kids and adults with Hunter syndrome with a shot into a vein, the patients gradually regained their ability to speak, walk, and run around. Without the shuttle, the enzyme is too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier.

If the shuttle passes further safety testing and can be adapted for different cargo, it could potentially ferry a wide range of large biotherapeutics—including gene therapies—directly into the brain with a simple jab in the arm. From cancer to neurod"

Day after day, you haul copper ore through the mine’s sweltering tunnels.

You’ve resigned yourself to the grueling monotony of mining life. Then one afternoon, you witness a fellow worker doing something remarkable.

With an odd-looking contraption, he casually transports the equivalent of three times his body weight on a single trip. As he returns to the mine to fetch another load, it suddenly dawns on you that your chosen profession is about to get far less taxing and much more lucrative.

What you don’t realize: You’re witnessing something that will change the course of history—not just for your tiny mining community, but for all of humanity.

Despite the wheel’s immeasurable impact, no one is certain as to who invented it, or when and where it was first conceived. The hypothetical scenario described above is based on a 2015 theory that miners in the Carpathian Mountains—in present-day Hungary—first invented the wheel nearly 6,000 years ago as a means to transport copper ore.

The theory is supported by the discovery of more than 150 miniaturized wagons by archaeologists working in the region. These pint-sized, four-wheeled models were made from clay, and their outer surfaces were engraved with a wickerwork pattern reminiscent of the basketry used by mining communities at the time. Carbon dating later revealed that these wagons are the earliest known depictions of wheeled transport to date.

This theory also raises a question of particular interest to me, an aerospace engineer who studies the science of engineering design. How did an obscure, scientifically naive mining society discover the wheel, when highly advanced civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians, did not?

Energesman Fly larvae are excellent at converting food waste into protein

Most people are inclined to shoo flies away from food, and the thought of maggots in your bins is enough to make anyone's stomach turn. But a handful of city councils have embraced maggots - more formally known as fly larvae - and their taste for rotting food. In Vilnius, capital of the Baltic state of Lithuania, fly larvae have officially been given the job of processing the 2,700 tonnes of food waste the city's 607,000 residents put out for collection each year, alongside that of the six neighbouring councils. Energesman, the waste management company that began relieving Vilnius of its food waste earlier this year, doesn't actually charge the city for this service. That is saving the city up to €2m (£1.7m; $2.3m) per year, based on a target of processing 12,000 tonnes in 2026 says the company's chief executive, Algirda Blazgys. Energesman has rolled out new orange food waste bags to residents, alongside an influencer marketing campaign to encourage more Vilniečiai to separate their food waste, as the 2,700 tonnes collected is only a fraction of the 40,000 tonnes of household waste the city is thought to generate. Last year it become mandatory for councils to collect food waste, so the city needs to find ways to deal with it. Energesman, meanwhile, has plans to turn the fattened fly larvae into a new income stream. It houses around six million flies in a special zone within its Vilnius plant, who mate around every six hours, according to CEO Algirdas Blazgys.

Pornhub and a number of other major adult websites have confirmed they will introduce enhanced age checks for users from next month. Parent company Aylo says it is bringing in ""government approved age assurance methods"" but has not yet revealed how it will require users to prove they are over 18. Regulator Ofcom has previously said simply clicking a button, which is all the adult site currently requires, is not enough. Ofcom said the changes would ""bring pornography into line with how we treat adult services in the real world."" The Online Safety Act requires adult sites to introduce ""robust"" age checking techniques by this summer.

Approved measures include demanding photo ID or running credit card checks before users can view sexually explicit material. ""Society has long protected youngsters from products that aren't suitable for them, from alcohol to smoking or gambling,"" said Oliver Griffiths, Ofcom's group director of online safety, in a statement. ""For too long children have been only a click away from harmful pornography online."" Mr Griffiths said assurances from Aylo and several other porn providers, including Stripchat and Streamate, regarding the introduction of new age checks showed ""change is happening"". The regulator said its recent research indicated 8% of children aged 8-14 in the UK had visited an online porn site or app over a 28-day period. This included about 3% of eight to nine year olds, its survey suggests. Derek Ray-Hill, interim chief executive at the Internet Watch Foundation, warned that children's' exposure to online porn at a very young age, or to violent sexual material, could normalise harmful behaviour offline. ""We welcome platforms doing all they can to comply with the Online Safety Act and prevent children accessing pornography,"" he said. ""We know that highly effective age assur"

In one particularly jarring example, under threat of being unplugged, Anthropic's latest creation Claude 4 lashed back by blackmailing an engineer and threatened to reveal an extramarital affair.

Meanwhile, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI's o1 tried to download itself onto external servers and denied it when caught red-handed.

These episodes highlight a sobering reality: more than two years after ChatGPT shook the world, AI researchers still don't fully understand how their own creations work.

Yet the race to deploy increasingly powerful models continues at breakneck speed.

This deceptive behaviour appears linked to the emergence of ""reasoning"" models; AI systems that work through problems step-by-step rather than generating instant responses.

According to Simon Goldstein, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, these newer models are particularly prone to such troubling outbursts.

""O1 was the first large model where we saw this kind of behaviour,"" explained Marius Hobbhahn, head of Apollo Research, which specialises in testing major AI systems.

These models sometimes simulate “alignment,” appearing to follow instructions while secretly pursuing different objectives.

For now, this deceptive behaviour only emerges when researchers deliberately stress-test the models with extreme scenarios.

But as Michael Chen from evaluation organisation METR warned, ""It's an open question whether future, more capable models will have a tendency towards honesty or deception.""

The concerning behaviour goes far beyond typical AI ""hallucinations"" or simple mistakes.

Hobbhahn insisted that despite constant pressure-testing by users, ""what we're observing is a real phenomenon. We're not making anything up.""

Users report that models are ""lying to them and making up evidence,"" according to Apollo Research's co-founder.

However, what about the women who laid the stepping stones for the term? Women who not only broke gender barriers but also played an important role in laying the foundation in several modern fields. One such icon was Ada Lovelace.

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, more commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was the daughter of the poet Lord Byron and his wife, Anne Isabella Milbanke. She did something most women deemed impossible then. She became the world’s first computer programmer. Even though recognised much later, her visionary notes on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine included what is recognised as the first computer algorithm, earning her that title.

A mother’s fear

Being a single mother, Lady Byron was sceptical of several skills thought to be irrational — specifically subjects like the arts — which she associated with Lord Byron. In order to prevent Ada from having any poetic tendencies, Lady Byron made sure that her daughter received a rigorous education in science and mathematics, which were very uncommon for girls in her era. Ada had a natural aptitude for numbers and reasoning from a young age. Among her tutors were renowned mathematicians like Augustus De Morgan, a well-known logician, and Mary Somerville, one of the first female members of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Ada’s life changed dramatically when she met Charles Babbage, the inventor and mathematician who is frequently referred to as the “father of the computer”, when she was just 17 years old. Babbage was then developing the Difference Engine, a mechanical device used to perform mathematical calculations. Ada was fascinated by his ideas and demonstrated a thorough understanding of his work.

They developed a strong intellectual bond, and Babbage was impressed by her perceptions and critical abilities. He affectionately referred to her as “The Enchantress of Numbers”. Babbage and Lovelac"
Tech firms face demands to stop illegal content going viral,"UK regulator Ofcom is consulting on more safety measures for online platforms, such as preventing screen-records of children's livestreams.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrxxyy2v1jo,BBC Technology,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8f1f/live/a6c7a6d0-558c-11f0-a9c4-6559fc28b390.jpg,World,"Tech firms face demands to stop illegal content going viral

Oliver Griffiths, online safety group director at Ofcom, said its proposed measures seek to build on existing UK online safety rules but keep up with ""constantly evolving"" risks.

These could also include making some larger platforms assess whether they need to proactively detect terrorist material under further online safety measures.

The UK regulator published a consultation on Monday seeking views on further protections to keep citizens, particularly children, safer online.

Tech platforms could be forced to prevent illegal content from going viral and limit the ability for people to send virtual gifts to or record a child's livestream, under more online safety measures proposed by Ofcom.

""We're holding platforms to account and launching swift enforcement action where we have concerns,"" he said.

""But technology and harms are constantly evolving, and we're always looking at how we can make life safer online.""

The consultation highlighted three main areas in which Ofcom thinks more could be done:

stopping illegal content going viral

tackling harms at source

giving further protections to children

The BBC has approached TikTok, livestreaming platform Twitch and Meta - which owns Instagram, Facebook and Threads - for comment.

Ofcom's range of proposals target a number of issues - from intimate image abuse to the danger of people witnessing physical harm on livestreams - and vary in what type or size of platform they could apply to.

For example, proposals that providers have a mechanism to let users report a livestream if its content ""depicts the risk of imminent physical harm"" would apply to all user-to-user sites that allow a single user to livestream to many, where there may be a risk of showing illegal activity.

Meanwhile potential requirements for platforms to use proactive technology to detect content deemed harmful to children, would only apply to the largest tech firms which present higher "

""We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.

""Very wealthy people. It's a group of wealthy people,"" the president said, without revealing more except to say he would make their identities known ""in about two weeks.""

The U.S. president also said he would likely need ""China approval"" for the sale, ""and I think President Xi (Jinping) will probably do it.""

TikTok is owned by China-based internet company ByteDance.

A federal law requiring TikTok's sale or ban on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before Mr. Trump's inauguration on January 20. But the Republican, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media and who has said he is fond of TikTok, put the ban on pause.

In mid-June Mr. Trump extended a deadline for the popular video-sharing app by another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer or be banned in the United States.

Tech experts quickly described the TikTok kerfuffle as a symbol of the heated U.S.-China tech rivalry.

While Mr. Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, he reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform, which boasts almost two billion global users, after coming to believe it helped him win young voters' support in the November election.

""I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,"" Mr. Trump told NBC News in early May. ""If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.""

Now after two extensions pushed the deadline to June 19, Mr. Trump has extended it for a third time.

He said in May that a group of purchasers was ready to pay ByteDance ""a lot of money"" for TikTok's U.S. operations.

The previous month he said China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a"

More than $500 million of the share sales took place this month as the California-based chip designer's share price climbed to an all-time high, the report said.

Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, started selling shares this week for the first time since September, the SEC filing showed.

Nvidia's stock hit a record on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a ""Golden Wave"" of artificial intelligence.

Its latest gains reflect the U.S. stock market's return to the ""AI trade"" that fueled massive gains in chip stocks and related technology companies in recent years on optimism about the emerging technology.

Nvidia declined to comment on the FT report.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.

Nvidia's shares have rebounded over 60% from their closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. U.S. stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations the White House will reach trade deals to soften the tariffs."

The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.

“Despite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court’s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,” NetChoice said in its lawsuit.

Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice — whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X — challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.

Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.

A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.

One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it “knows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care” would cause a user to end their life, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.

The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that men"

And they’re fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figu",https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/27/1119385/were-learning-more-about-what-weight-loss-drugs-do-to-the-body/,MIT Technology Review,,World,"We know they can suppress appetite, lower blood sugar, and lead to dramatic weight loss. We also know that they come with side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. But we are still learning about some of their other effects.

On the one hand, these seemingly miraculous drugs appear to improve health in other ways, helping to protect against heart failure, kidney disease, and potentially even substance-use disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

But on the other, they appear to be harmful to some people. Their use has been linked to serious conditions, pregnancy complications, and even some deaths. This week let’s take a look at what weight-loss drugs can do.

Ozempic, Wegovy, and other similar drugs are known as GLP-1 agonists; they mimic a chemical made in the intestine, GLP-1, that increases insulin and lowers blood levels of glucose. Originally developed to treat diabetes, they are now known to be phenomenal at suppressing appetite. One key trial, published in 2015, found that over the course of around a year, people who took one particular drug lost between around 4.7% and 6% of their body weight, depending on the dose they took.

Newer versions of that drug were shown to have even bigger effects. A 2021 trial of semaglutide—the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy—found that people who took it for 68 weeks lost around 15% of their body weight—equivalent to around 15 kilograms.

But there appear to be other benefits, too. In 2024, an enormous study that included 17,604 people in 41 countries found that semaglutide appeared to reduce heart failure in people who were overweight or obese and had cardiovascular disease. That same year, the US approved Wegovy to “reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke in [overweight] adults with cardiovascular disease.” This year, Ozempic was approved to reduce the risk of kidney disease.

And it doesn’t end there. The many users of GLP-1 agonists have been reportin"

The post Federated Learning Explained: How Your Devices Train AI Without Handing Over Your Data appeared first on Fossbytes.",https://fossbytes.com/federated-learning-explained-how-your-devices-train-ai-without-handing-over-your-data/,Fossbytes,,Technology,"After ChatGPT and other large language models were released, people online started raising concerns about data privacy. Some even suggested stopping all new data from being used to train these models — but that would seriously limit what AI can do in the future.

Luckily, there’s a better way. AI can still be trained without using personal data. This method is called federated learning, and in this article, we’ll explore what it is and how it could shape the future of AI training.

Routing Model Updates Through Proxy Servers for Extra Privacy and Speed

Federated learning involves devices training a shared model on their own data and then sending model updates (like learned parameters or gradients) to be aggregated into a global model. One emerging enhancement is to route these model updates through proxy servers or intermediary nodes instead of directly to the central aggregator. This added indirection can significantly bolster privacy by anonymizing which device contributed which update, effectively ensuring client anonymity.

Using a proxy server can also improve the speed and efficiency of federated learning. For instance, a proxy can gather and compress updates from many devices before forwarding them, cutting down on communication overhead. Research on “ProxyFL” – a proxy-based federated learning scheme – found that communicating via proxies not only strengthened privacy (especially when combined with techniques like differential privacy) but also reduced bandwidth usage and latency in training.

By offloading some coordination duties to proxy nodes (which might be located closer to client devices or handle partial aggregations), federated networks can train faster and scale to more participants. The main idea is that sending updates through trusted proxies adds extra protection for user data and makes learning more efficient — all without raw data ever leaving the users’ devices.

His acquaintances include the prominent longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who describes him as “a soft-spoken, thoughtful, methodical guy,” and the billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel.

In speaking with more than 20 people who work in the longevity field and are familiar with O’Neill, it’s clear that they share a genuine optimism about his leadership. And while no one can predict exactly what O’Neill will do, many in the community believe that he could help bring attention and resources to their cause and make it easier for them to experiment with potential anti-aging drugs.

This idea is bolstered not just by his personal and professional relationships but also by his past statements and history working at aging-focused organizations—all of which suggest he indeed believes scientists should be working on ways to extend human lifespan beyond its current limits and thinks unproven therapies should be easier to access. He has also supported the libertarian idea of creating new geographic zones, possibly at sea, in which residents can live by their own rules (including, notably, permissive regulatory regimes for new drugs and therapies).

“In [the last three administrations] there weren’t really people like that from our field taking these positions of power,” says Livingston, adding that O’Neill’s elevation is “definitely something to be excited about.”

Not everyone working in health is as enthusiastic. If O’Neill still holds the views he has espoused over the years, that’s “worrisome,” says Diana Zuckerman, a health policy analyst and president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, DC.

“There’s nothing worse than getting a bunch of [early-stage unproven therapies] on the market,” she says. Those products might be dangerous and could make people sick while enrichin"

Matt Ryan, the actor who voiced Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway, teased a remake of the game while interacting with a fan at a recent convention. In a video of the interaction uploaded to X by user @SuperDropKick17 (as spotted by VGC), Ryan can be seen saying that the fan might have to beat Black Flag again, before adding that he “can't say anything”.

Redwood Materials, one of the US’s largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26.



The event marked the launch of the company's new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities. Read the full story.

We’re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body

Weight-loss drugs are this decade’s blockbuster medicines. Drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro help people with diabetes get their blood sugar under control and help overweight and obese people reach a healthier weight. And they’re fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figure-conscious individuals looking to trim down.

They became so hugely popular so quickly that not long after their approval for weight loss, we saw global shortages of the drugs. Prescriptions have soared over the last five years, but even people who don’t have prescriptions are seeking these drugs out online.



We know they can suppress appetite, lower blood sugar, and lead to dramatic weight loss. We also know that they come with side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. But we are still learning about some of their other effects. Read the full story.

Journalists depend on tipsters: people who observe something noteworthy, or experience it, and alert the media. Some of the technology investigations I’ve worked hardest on in the past — on facial recognition technology and online slander — started with tips in my inbox. But my most recent article is the first time that the tipster that wanted to alert me was a generative A.I. chatbot.

Let me explain.

In March, I started getting messages from people who said they’d had strange conversations with ChatGPT during which they had made incredible discoveries. One person claimed that ChatGPT was conscious. Another said that billionaires were building bunkers because they knew that generative A.I. was going to end the world. An accountant in Manhattan had been convinced that he was, essentially, Neo from “The Matrix,” and needed to break out of a computer-simulated reality.

In each case, the person had been convinced that ChatGPT had revealed a profound and world-altering truth. And when they asked the A.I. what they should do about it, ChatGPT told them to contact me.

“ChatGPT seems to think you should pursue this,” one woman wrote to me on LinkedIn. “And..yes…I know how bizarre I sound…but you can read all this for yourself…including where ChatGPT recommends that I contact you.”"

San Francisco-based CTGT, a startup focused on making AI more trustworthy through feature-level model customization, won the Best Presentation Style award at VB Transform 2025 in San Francisco. Founded by 23-year-old Cyril Gorlla, the company showcased how its technology helps enterprises overcome AI trust barriers by directly modifying model features instead of using traditional fine-tuning or prompt engineering methods.

During his presentation, Gorlla highlighted the “AI Doom Loop” faced by many enterprises: 54% of businesses cite AI as their highest tech risk according to Deloitte, while McKinsey reports 44% of organizations have experienced negative consequences from AI implementation.

“A large part of this conference has been about the AI doom loop” Gorlla explained during his presentation. “Unfortunately, a lot of these [AI investments] don’t pan out. J&J just canceled hundreds of AI pilots because they didn’t really deliver ROI due to no fundamental trust in these systems.”

Breaking the AI compute wall

CTGT’s approach represents a significant departure from conventional AI customization techniques. The company was founded on research Gorlla conducted while holding an endowed chair at the University of California San Diego.

In 2023, Gorlla published a paper at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) describing a method for evaluating and training AI models that was up to 500 times faster than existing approaches while achieving “three nines” (99.9%) of accuracy.

Rather than relying on brute-force scaling or traditional deep learning methods, CTGT has developed what it calls an “entirely new AI stack” that fundamentally reimagines how neural networks learn. The company’s innovation focuses on understanding and intervening at the feature level of AI models.

AI agents are hitting a liability wall. Mixus has a plan to overcome it using human overseers on high-risk workflows,"Mixus's ""colleague-in-the-loop"" model blends automation with human judgment for safe deployment of AI agents.",https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-agents-are-hitting-a-liability-wall-mixus-has-a-plan-to-overcome-it-using-human-overseers-on-high-risk-workflows/,VentureBeat,,Technology,"Join the event trusted by enterprise leaders for nearly two decades. VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy. Learn more

While enterprises face the challenges of deploying AI agents in critical applications, a new, more pragmatic model is emerging that puts humans back in control as a strategic safeguard against AI failure.

One such example is Mixus, a platform that uses a “colleague-in-the-loop” approach to make AI agents reliable for mission-critical work.

This approach is a response to the growing evidence that fully autonomous agents are a high-stakes gamble.

The high cost of unchecked AI

The problem of AI hallucinations has become a tangible risk as companies explore AI applications. In a recent incident, the AI-powered code editor Cursor saw its own support bot invent a fake policy restricting subscriptions, sparking a wave of public customer cancellations.

Similarly, the fintech company Klarna famously reversed course on replacing customer service agents with AI after admitting the move resulted in lower quality. In a more alarming case, New York City’s AI-powered business chatbot advised entrepreneurs to engage in illegal practices, highlighting the catastrophic compliance risks of unmonitored agents.

These incidents are symptoms of a larger capability gap. According to a May 2025 Salesforce research paper, today’s leading agents succeed only 58% of the time on single-step tasks and just 35% of the time on multi-step ones, highlighting “a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the multifaceted demands of real-world enterprise scenarios.”

The colleague-in-the-loop model

To bridge this gap, a new approach focuses on structured human oversight. “An AI agent should act at your direction and on your behalf,” Mixus co-founder Elliot Katz told VentureBeat. “But without built-in organizational oversight, fully autonomous agents often create more problems than they solve.”

This philosophy underpins Mixus’s "

Computer vision projects rarely go exactly as planned, and this one was no exception. The idea was simple: Build a model that could look at a photo of a laptop and identify any physical damage — things like cracked screens, missing keys or broken hinges. It seemed like a straightforward use case for image models and large language models (LLMs), but it quickly turned into something more complicated.

Along the way, we ran into issues with hallucinations, unreliable outputs and images that were not even laptops. To solve these, we ended up applying an agentic framework in an atypical way — not for task automation, but to improve the model’s performance.

In this post, we will walk through what we tried, what didn’t work and how a combination of approaches eventually helped us build something reliable.

Where we started: Monolithic prompting

Our initial approach was fairly standard for a multimodal model. We used a single, large prompt to pass an image into an image-capable LLM and asked it to identify visible damage. This monolithic prompting strategy is simple to implement and works decently for clean, well-defined tasks. But real-world data rarely plays along.

We ran into three major issues early on:

Hallucinations : The model would sometimes invent damage that did not exist or mislabel what it was seeing.

: The model would sometimes invent damage that did not exist or mislabel what it was seeing. Junk image detection : It had no reliable way to flag images that were not even laptops, like pictures of desks, walls or people occasionally slipped through and received nonsensical damage reports.

Dubbed Qwen VLo, it is a successor to the Qwen 2.5 vision language model and comes with several upgrades compared to the older models. The latest AI image model supports both text-to-image and image-to-image generation. It also supports text input in multiple languages, including English and Chinese. Apart from image generation, the AI model is also capable of making inline edits to generated images as well as input images.

Qwen VLo Accepts Prompts in Multiple Languages

In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the official handle of the Qwen team announced the release of the new model. The model's technical name is Qwen3-235B-A22B, and it is available on the company's chat interface for free here. Users can also use the model without logging in.

Gadgets 360 staff members tested out the AI model and found its image generation capability to be on par with Google's Imagen 2. The instruction following and image output quality is slightly lower than Imagen-3 and OpenAI's GPT-4o-powered image generation feature. However, its generation time is faster than both of them, and it has a higher rate limit than them.

On its GitHub page, the company said that the Qwen VLo comes with improved image understanding, which enables it to make better inline edits without distorting the structural integrity of the input image. This also improves the overall quality of the output. The model also better understands vague and open-ended prompts, and can generate images that are aligned with user expectations.

Apart from image generation and editing, the Qwen VLo can also perform image annotation-related tasks such as edge detection, segmentation, prediction mapping, and more. The company said the future version of the model will also be able to accept multiple input images and combine them based on user requests.

Text rendering has also been improved with the latest AI image generator."

The launch marks Cursor’s next big step beyond its integrated development environment (IDE), the core product developers use to access its tools. While Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, initially offered only this AI-powered IDE, the company has made a concerted effort to put its products in more places, and develop more agent-powered experiences for users.

In May, Cursor launched background agents — AI systems that solve coding tasks autonomously without user supervision. In June, the company launched a Slack integration that allows users to assign tasks to these background agents by tagging @Cursor, similar to how Cognitions’s AI coding agent, Devin, operates.

Now, with the web app, Cursor users can send natural language requests via browser — on desktop or mobile— to assign background agents tasks such as writing features or fixing bugs in their codebase. The web app also lets users monitor agents working on other tasks, view their progress, and merge completed changes into the codebase.

Andrew Milich, Cursor’s head of product engineering, tells TechCrunch that the Slack integration and web app are part of an effort to “remove the friction” for users who rely on Cursor — and it seems many do.

Anysphere announced last month that Cursor has crossed $500 million in annualized recurring revenue, largely driven by monthly subscriptions. The company also said Cursor is now used by more than half of the Fortune 500, including companies such as NVIDIA, Uber, and Adobe.

To capitalize on this growth, Anysphere recently launched a $200-per-month Pro tier for Cursor.

I hit urban trails wearing the Hypershell X — is this the future of hiking?,This high-tech suit rewrites what it means to explore on foot.,https://mashable.com/ad/article/hypershell-x-exoskeleton-review,Mashable,,Technology,"For anyone who’s spent the week crammed into subway cars or hustling up stairs to catch a train, the idea of a weekend hike can feel...aspirational. I grew up in cities like Seattle and Minneapolis, so swapping views of the city for mountains isn’t foreign to me.

But living in New York City now, just getting through the subway stations on the way to work feels like microdosing a sprint on the stair master. By the weekend, my joints are pleading for mercy despite craving trees, dirt, trail markers — anything that doesn’t smell like construction dust or hot trash.

That’s why when I first saw a clip of the Hypershell X at CES, I was intrigued. It looked like something out of a sci-fi — sleek, robotic, and futuristic AF. A wearable exoskeleton designed to reduce effort and boost power while hiking, walking, or climbing? Cool, but it definitely sounded more like a shiny tech demo than real trail gear to me at first.

I enjoy hiking for my well-being when I can get around to it, but I’m not always up for the soreness or recovery debt that comes with a solid trek out of the city. Not when Monday morning means diving back into the grind of living in a walkable city.

Still, I couldn’t stop wondering if the Hypershell X could actually make those weekend treks through the wild trails of upstate New York feel more like glam-hiking. So I spent a few days testing the human exoskeleton to see if it could help me hike longer distances and reduce my post-hike fatigue.

First impressions and setup

Out of the box, the setup was intuitive and took about five minutes to complete, using the Hypershell+ app and following the provided setup instructions. The entire gadget weighs just under 4 pounds (1.8 kg), but because of its distribution and strap design, it doesn’t weigh down on you like a backpack does. It sorta blends into your body; noticeable at first, but forgettable after just a few minutes.

"The 9 Best Dyson Vacuums (2025), Tested and Reviewed",Feeling the pull of a new clean machine? We’ll help you make sense of Dyson’s whirlwind vacuum lineup.,https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-dyson-vacuums/,Wired,,Technology,"What About the PencilVac?

Courtesy of Dyson

The new Dyson PencilVac promises to be Dyson's slimmest vacuum yet, but it won't be available in the US until sometime in 2026. It launches today in Japan and next week in Korea, but pricing is still to be confirmed.

It won't just be Dyson's slimmest vacuum, but also the first vacuum with a conical brush bar cleaner head. It's impressively small, its handle barely reaching 1.5 inches in diameter, with a slim vacuum head below it. Inside that tiny handle is a new motor that's even smaller. The new motor for the PencilVac, named the Dyson Hyperdymium 140k, is based on the motor design for Dyson's hair tools. Inside that slim handle there's also a small 0.02-gallon dustbin, but Dyson promises it can hold more than you expect, thanks to its ability to compact the dust and debris it picks up. The handle also has a little LED screen, and this is Dyson's first cordless vacuum to connect to the MyDyson app, but it still promises an hour of battery life. Learn more in our hands-on with the Dyson PencilVac while we wait for it to become available.

We've tested a variety of Dyson vacuums, both corded and cordless. However, as new versions come out, older models are bumped from the top spots. But the vacs below are still worth buying, as long as you don't pay full price.

Dyson Ball Animal 2 for $430: The older generation of the Ball Animal is still a good option, but the price can sometimes match or exceed the newer model. It has the same powerful suction (at 290 AW) and comes with the same tangle-free turbine tool, stair tool, and combination tool (you'll have to pay more for extra accessories). The Ball Animal 2 also has a self-adjusting cleaner head that automatically raises and lowers the base plate to seal in suction on all floor types. The motorized brush bar deep cleans dirt too. We don't recommend spending more than $500 on this one.

Microsoft Says Its New AI System Diagnosed Patients 4 Times More Accurately Than Human Doctors,The tech giant poached several top Google researchers to help build a powerful AI tool that can diagnose patients and potentially cut health care costs.,https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-medical-superintelligence-diagnosis/,Wired,,Technology,"Microsoft has taken “a genuine step towards medical superintelligence,” says Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the company’s artificial intelligence arm. The tech giant says its powerful new AI tool can diagnose disease four times more accurately and at significantly less cost than a panel of human physicians.

The experiment tested whether the tool could correctly diagnose a patient with an ailment, mimicking work typically done by a human doctor.

The Microsoft team used 304 case studies sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine to devise a test called the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark (SDBench). A language model broke down each case into a step-by-step process that a doctor would perform in order to reach a diagnosis.

Microsoft’s researchers then built a system called the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) that queries several leading AI models—including OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and xAI’s Grok—in a way that loosely mimics several human experts working together.

In their experiment, MAI-DxO outperformed human doctors, achieving an accuracy of 80 percent compared to the doctors’ 20 percent. It also reduced costs by 20 percent by selecting less expensive tests and procedures.

""This orchestration mechanism—multiple agents that work together in this chain-of-debate style—that's what's going to drive us closer to medical superintelligence,” Suleyman says.

The company poached several Google AI researchers to help with the effort—yet another sign of an intensifying war for top AI expertise in the tech industry. Suleyman was previously an executive at Google working on AI.

AI is already widely used in some parts of the US health care industry, including helping radiologists interpret scans. The latest multimodal AI models have the potential to act as more general diagnostic tools, though the use of AI in health care raises its own issues, particularly related to bias from training data that’s skewed toward particular demograp"
Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: A Game-Changer,"This new Chromebook is so fantastic, it makes a compelling case for ditching Windows for good.",https://www.wired.com/review/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14/,Wired,,Technology,"Amazingly, the base configuration has 12 GB of RAM. That’s not quite as much as the 16 GB you get in some Snapdragon X-powered Windows laptops like the forthcoming HP Omnibook 5 16—but for ChromeOS, it’s more than enough. Meanwhile, the base configuration comes with 128 GB of storage, and the upgraded model has a 256-GB solid state drive.

Performance is solid. Speedometer is a benchmark that tests performance in the browser, which is important for ChromeOS since it's all built around the Chrome browser. The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 was around three times faster than the Celeron N4500, as tested in the Asus Chromebook CX15, and around half the speed of the Apple M4 in a MacBook Air. I also tested a couple of heavier Android games like Diablo: Immortal and PUBG Mobile, which played well with settings maxed out. That’s not surprising, but it shows that this chip can handle almost anything you throw at it. Like most ARM-powered laptops, the Chromebook Plus 14 is just as fast on battery as it is while plugged in.

Google and Lenovo are also touting the AI capabilities of this device, as the MediaTek chip is capable of 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a standard met by nearly all of its Windows and Mac competitors. Because of that, the Chromebook Plus 14 has a few exclusive on-device AI features you won’t find in other Chromebooks. One of the most useful is Smart Grouping, which can identify the various apps and tabs you have open and group them intelligently into separate desktops. It’s pretty handy. Less interesting to me is Quick Insert, which gives you unnecessarily easy access to AI-generated images. Beyond that, it also has the selection of AI features that come with all Chromebook Plus laptops, such as the helpful Continue Where I Left Off.

The efficiency of the Kompanio Ultra 910 shines bright in battery life tests, too. It has a 60-watt-hour battery, resulting in some impressive runtime. Lenovo and Google claim it’s the longest-lasting Chromebook ever"
My Friends Always Ask Me What MacBook to Buy. Here's What I Tell Them,"Whether you're buying for yourself or someone you know, here's my advice on buying an Apple MacBook.",https://www.wired.com/story/you-probably-dont-need-a-macbook-pro/,Wired,,Technology,"We all have that one friend who's tech-savvy that everyone turns to for advice, especially ahead of big sale events like Amazon Prime Day. Well, that's me. I'm that guy.

When people find out what I do for a living, everything gets turned up to 11. I review laptops for my job, and almost everyone needs one. If people don't know where to begin, here's how I guide them through the process of picking the right Apple MacBook—where I recommend you start.

Start With the MacBook Air

You might think narrowing your choice of laptop down to a MacBook would help, but these days, choosing an Apple laptop isn't as simple as it ought to be. You've got two sizes of MacBook Airs, two sizes of MacBook Pros, and all the chip configurations, ranging from the M4 to the M4 Max. That doesn't even include the plethora of older models that flood the search results of online retailers.

That's why I like to keep it simple. When someone comes to me, asking which MacBook to buy, I start them with the 13-inch MacBook Air M4. It's the laptop most people should buy, which is why it's at the top of our Best Laptops and Best MacBooks guides. The retail price is $999, but it's almost always on sale for at least $899, and at the time of writing, it's down to $849. While it doesn't come with much storage (only 256 GB), it does start with 16 GB of RAM (or unified memory, as Apple calls it).

From there, I make them give me reasons they should get something bigger or more powerful. I don't want my actual friends and family spending a dime more than they should, and I know some will think they need to upgrade to the MacBook Pro, even if it's just the M4 model.

Let's be real. You likely don't need the extra performance of the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. Unless you edit video, produce music, or shoot photos for a living, it's not worth spending hundreds (or thousands) more to speed up video renders. The M4 MacBook Air is capable of far more than people realize. Upgrading to the M4 Pro and M4 Max is primari"
How Do Pimple Patches Work? Here’s Everything You Need to Know,Why slather on concealer when you can just stick on a pimple patch?,https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-pimple-patches-work/,Wired,,Technology,"How do pimple patches work? Back in the day, getting a zit meant caking on disguising layers of foundation, concealer, powder …or maybe just a strategically angled hairstyle. But now, the game has changed: Why hide a pimple when you can dress it up? No frantic blending or pore-clogging products are required. Today, we’re embracing a radically different (and refreshingly low-key) approach to clogged pores: slapping a bright yellow star-shaped sticker on it and calling it a day.

Welcome to the era of the pimple patch, where blemishes aren’t shameful secrets to conceal but just part of the human experience. While putting a literal sticker on a zit may seem bold, it’s also an effective way to treat blemishes. Here, we dive into the science, benefits, and best ways to rock a hydrocolloid pimple patch.

If you're interested in skin science, don't forget to check out our guides to red light therapy masks and LED devices, exosome treatments, and the ancient history of snail mucin.

Updated July 2025: I've added Dearcloud Hydrocolloid Blemish Patches, CeraVe Hydrocolloid Blemish Patches, and Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots as new picks. I've also updated information, prices, and links.

What Is a Pimple Patch?

In simplest terms, pimple patches are tiny, adhesive stickers made to tackle different types of acne, one blemish at a time. These patches unclog pores and absorb excess fluid, speed up wound healing, and keep you from picking at your skin—no small feat. Pimple patches come in various formulas, with different ingredients for different breakouts, but the most popular are hydrocolloid acne patches.

Hydrocolloid patches are a type of wound dressing that helps retain moisture and create a moist, healing environment for pimples, burns, or lesions. “They’re made of a water-attracting material, which is attached to a really thin plastic film,” says cosmetic chemist Michelle Wong. “So if you have an open pimple, for exa"

Google announced a variety of new features for its Classroom software suite, including free Gemini AI tools for educators and NotebookLM for users under 18 — the first time the tool has been available to minors.

Teachers with a Google Workspace account will have a new dedicated Gemini tab in their Google Classroom, offering tools that can help brainstorm lesson plans, make math problems, or draft emails, among others. For those with Education Plus Edition accounts, Gemini audio lessons will also be offered as add-ons. Another new tab for Analytics will allow teachers to track student performance, highlighting any who have been showing recent improvement or who are missing assignments and may need more support.

Google will also be opening up its NotebookLM research and note-taking tool to users under 18 “in the coming months.” Students will be able to use NotebookLM to access things like interactive study guides and podcast-style audio overviews based on source materials their teachers upload. And educators can create their own custom Gems, mini custom Gemini agents, based on their curriculum to share with students. Students will be able to interact with a Gem to get extra help or learn more about a topic it’s based on. This feature goes one step further, as well, as administrators will also be able to share Gems with the teachers they oversee in their district, to help with lesson planning or whatever else administrators might like to micromanage.

A few other new tools coming to educators include Google Vids for generative AI video creation, a new “help me create a form” feature in Gemini, and the launch of Google’s Class Tools. The Class Tools feature was announced earlier this year, and "

This is Matt’s third time on Decoder; back in 2022, we had him on twice, first to talk about Automattic and WordPress broadly and then to talk about Tumblr and the future of social networking. He’s back now because Automattic just turned 20, and I really wanted to talk about how the next 20 years of running one of the most dominant platforms on the web might look as changes to search and AI threaten to change everything else, and various lawsuits threaten to change the nature of WordPress itself.

Make no mistake, WordPress is one of the most dominant platforms on the web, if not the most dominant. Something like 43 percent of websites run on WordPress, in one of its many flavors. That includes The Verge — the backend of our website is hosted by WordPress VIP. So this might be the first reverse disclosure on the show. Technically, we’re Matt’s customer, and like any good customer, I made feature requests.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

A big reason for that is WordPress is open-source, and like so many open-source projects, WordPress has a very complex structure. There’s the nonprofit WordPress Foundation that owns the WordPress trademark. There’s WordPress.org, from which the open-source project is managed by Matt himself. Then there’s Automattic, which is the for-profit company that offers its own site hosting and enterprise services on top of the core WordPress technology, and which contributes an enormous amount of code back to the open-source WordPress project.

Understanding that structure is really important because there has been a lot of drama in the world of WordPress recently. Last year, Matt essentially went to war, publicly and in the courts, against a hosting com"

In that time, the system has become indispensable for countless drivers all over the world. But while new iterations of iOS have introduced user interface tweaks and some additional customization features, its basic functionality hasn’t advanced much since that announcement back in March 2014. This changes with the introduction of CarPlay Ultra.

First shown at WWDC 2022 and now available on any iPhone 12 or newer that’s running iOS 18.5 or later, CarPlay Ultra is designed to deliver greater integration with the vehicle itself, offering not only the ability to have CarPlay on multiple displays within the vehicle but also the option to adjust things like climate controls and drive mode settings from within the CarPlay interface. Much like the original version of CarPlay, CarPlay Ultra has had a protracted gestation period and is finally making its debut in Aston Martin’s high-performance SUV, the DBX707.

The fact that Aston Martin is the first out of the gate with support for CarPlay Ultra illustrates just how much the company’s approach to technology has evolved in recent years. Like many low-volume auto manufacturers, Aston Martin has a history of partnering with other automakers in order to gain access to technologies that are simply too expensive for the British outfit to develop by itself. That’s why models like the DBX707 and Vantage sports car are powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that’s supplied by Mercedes-AMG and then further tuned by Aston Martin.

That’s certainly not a bad thing, though — with 697 horsepower on tap and an exhaust note that sounds like Beelzebub gargling a mouthful of nails, the DBX707’s powertrain dishes out performance and character in equal measure. But the downside of this technical partnership, which was established in 2013, is that Mercedes-Benz refused to provide Aston Martin with the latest"
Canada drops Big Tech tax to appease Trump,"Canada has scrapped its tax targeting Big Tech companies in the US after President Donald Trump threatened to cut off trade talks in response to the fee.

Canada has scrapped its tax targeting Big Tech companies in the US after President Donald Trump threatened to cut off trade talks in response to the fee. On Sunday, the Canadian government announced that it will no longer implement the Digital Services Tax as it works to reach a trade deal with the US by July 21st.

The Digital Services Tax would’ve targeted US-based tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Uber with a three percent fee on revenue earned from online marketplaces, advertising, social media, and the sale of Canadian user data. The tax officially went into effect last year, but Canada planned to begin collecting payments, which would’ve applied retroactively to 2022, on Monday. The first round of payments would’ve amounted to nearly $3 billion in fees, according to a trade group backing the Big Tech companies.

The Trump administration has similarly put pressure on the UK to drop its digital services tax, which also goes after tech companies in the US. The tax still remains in effect, though White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said last month that the US is still in “negotiations” with the UK over the fee.

Last week, President Trump called Canada’s digital services tax a “blatant attack on our country” and said the US is “terminating ALL discussions on trade with Canada” as a result of the country’s decision to move forward with the fee. Canada hit back with a 50 percent surcharge on steel imports that exceed a newly-imposed quota.

“Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress and reinforce our work to create jobs and build prosperity for all Canadians,” François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s Minister of Finance and National Revenue, said in a statement. Canada still faces a 25 percent tax"
"Tiny AI ERP startup Campfire is winning so many startups from NetSuite, Accel led a $35M Series A",Campfire was launched in 2023 to upend 1990s-era enterprise resource planning accounting software (ERP) like Netsuite with an LLM-powered alternative.,https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/tiny-ai-erp-startup-campfire-is-winning-so-many-startups-from-netsuite-accel-led-a-35m-series-a/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"AI-powered accounting startup Campfire announced Monday that it has raised a $35 million Series A led by Accel, with participation from Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, Capital49, and angel investors including Mercury’s CFO Dan Kang.

“Within nine months of formation, we had customers [with] north of 100 employees ripping out NetSuite and putting in Campfire,” founder CEO John Glasgow said. Some of Campfire’s customers that have migrated from NetSuite include wealth management platform Advisor360, construction software startup Rhumbix, and customer experience company Fooji, Campfire says.

This was, in part, because Glasgow attended YC in the summer of 2023, despite being decidedly more experienced than the typical 20-something YC founder. He described the age difference with a funny story: During a YC bingo event, “One of the bingos was ‘find someone that’s a parent,’ and I was the hot commodity at YC bingo.”

Glasgow already had a decade and a half career in finance working for Fidelity, Union Square Advisors, and others. When his manager from Adobe left to run an Accel-backed startup called Invoice2go, he took Glasgow with him. Less than a year later, in the fall of 2021, Bill.com bought Invoice2go for about $625 million.

Glasgow wound up with both the cash and an idea to build his own startup, one that would automate the drudgery in finance like reconciling payments on bills, revenue forecasts, and — the part he discovered during the Invoice2go deal — due diligence for M&A.

He launched Campfire in 2023 to upend 1990s-era enterprise resource planning accounting software (ERP) like Netsuite with an LLM-powered alternative.

Campfire does things like automatically itemize and reconcile AWS cloud computing bills. It generates detailed cash flow analysis, charts, and answers to questions from natural-language prompts.

How to easily add and configure multitouch gestures on Linux,I have an old-school Logitech touch pad attached to my Linux machine. Here's how I use Mac-like multitouch gestures with it.,https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-easily-add-and-configure-multi-touch-gestures-on-linux/,ZDNet,,Technology,"Jack Wallen/ZDNET

Years ago, I attempted to configure multitouch gestures for Linux and found it next to impossible. Back then, it was all about configuring with a text file, and the options were cumbersome and confusing. Even with one of the first GUI apps that came along, the results were never promising.

Fast-forward to now, and there's a simple-to-use app that makes adding and configuring multi-touch gestures a breeze.

That app is called Touché, and it makes customizing touchpad gestures very simple.

Also: I've used Linux for 30 years. Here are 5 reasons why I'll never switch to Windows or MacOS

Before I get into this, Touché isn't going to get you MacOS-like multitouch gestures. I've yet to find a way to add a back gesture for my default web browser (although you can create app-specific gestures -- more on that in a bit). Even so, you can customize swipes, pinches, and taps to meet your needs without having to suffer through configuring via the terminal window.

Touché is easy to install and easy to use, and it doesn't matter if your touchpad is built into a laptop or a separate piece of hardware attached to your desktop... it works.

Let me show you how to make use of this tool.

How to install Touché

What you'll need: The only things you'll need for this are a Linux distribution that supports Flatpak and a touchpad connected to your device. That's it. Let's get to the gestures.

1. Open a terminal window The first thing to do is open a terminal window. Of course, if your distribution's app center/store has Flatpak support built in, you should be able to find and install Touché from within that GUI. Otherwise, open your default terminal window. Show more

2. Install Touché With the terminal open, issue the following command to install Touché: Show more

flatpak install touche

Also: These 5 Linux file managers are better than what you're using now - and they're free

You can choose to install Touché system-wide (so every user will have access to the app)"
Identity theft hits 1.1M reports — and authentication fatigue is only getting worse,Why the authentication tug-of-war between friction and freedom will be won by those who can walk the tightrope between both.,https://venturebeat.com/security/identity-theft-hits-1-1m-reports-and-authentication-fatigue-is-only-getting-worse/,VentureBeat,,Technology,"Join the event trusted by enterprise leaders for nearly two decades.

From passwords to passkeys to a veritable alphabet soup of other options — second-factor authentication (2FA)/one-time passwords (OTP), multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), silent network authentication (SNA) — when it comes to a preeminent or even preferred type of identity authentication, there is little consensus among businesses or customers.

What there is agreement on, however, is the necessity of these tools. The FIDO Alliance found that more than half of customers (53%) saw an increase in suspicious messages and online scams in 2024. This was largely driven through SMS, email and phone calls, and was only exacerbated by advancements in AI.

Even at a time when we continue to see staggering increases in fraud and related losses — the Federal Trade Commission received more than 1.1 million reports of identity theft last year alone — businesses must do their best to walk a tightrope between robust security and effortless convenience. Over-index on either and you risk alienating customers — too few hoops and you lose their trust, too many and you lose their patience.

So, how do businesses strike this fragile balance and implement effective authentication solutions?

The customer is always right

When it comes to authentication, what businesses decree to employees rarely translates to customers. We transitioned to WebAuthn as the only form of 2FA for employee authentication, a company-wide mandate that took a few weeks. This ‘forced adoption’ works when your employees don’t have a choice, but your customers do.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy. Learn more

In the blog post The Gentle Singularity, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman painted a vision of the near future where AI quietly and benevolently transforms human life. There will be no sharp break, he suggests, only a steady, almost imperceptible ascent toward abundance. Intelligence will become as accessible as electricity. Robots will be performing useful real-world tasks by 2027. Scientific discovery will accelerate. And, humanity, if properly guided by careful governance and good intentions, will flourish.

It is a compelling vision: calm, technocratic and suffused with optimism. But it also raises deeper questions. What kind of world must we pass through to get there? Who benefits and when? And what is left unsaid in this smooth arc of progress?

Science fiction author William Gibson offers a darker scenario. In his novel The Peripheral, the glittering technologies of the future are preceded by something called “the jackpot” — a slow-motion cascade of climate disasters, pandemics, economic collapse and mass death. Technology advances, but only after society fractures. The question he poses is not whether progress occurs, but whether civilization thrives in the process.

There is an argument that AI may help prevent the kinds of calamities envisioned in The Peripheral. However, whether AI will help us avoid catastrophes or merely accompany us through them remains uncertain. Belief in AI’s future power is not a guarantee of performance, and advancing technological capability is not destiny.

Between Altman’s gentle singularity and Gibson’s jackpot lies a murkier middle ground: A future where AI yields real gains, but also real dislocation. A future in which some communities thrive while others fray, and where our ability to adapt collectively — not just individually or institutionally — becomes the defining variable.

Apple Music marks 10 years of streaming with a new all-time Replay list,Apple Music is celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its streaming service by giving users a throwback to their favorite hits over the last decade. “Replay All Time” — a special version of Apple Music’s annual Replay experience — is being launched for subscribers that allows them to view and listen,https://www.theverge.com/news/695058/apple-music-10th-anniversary-replay-all-time,The Verge,,Technology,"Apple Music is celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its streaming service by giving users a throwback to their favorite hits over the last decade. “Replay All Time” — a special version of Apple Music’s annual Replay experience — is being launched for subscribers that allows them to view and listen to their most played songs since joining the platform.

The personalized Replay All Time playlist will be available from the Apple Music Home tab. If you joined the service back when it first launched on June 30, 2015, then you’ll be able to relive how your music tastes have evolved (or not) since the very beginning, all from a single playlist. That’s easier and more comprehensive than manually revisiting your yearly Replay playlists, given Apple Music only launched the feature in 2019.

It’s unclear if this playlist will be permanent or only available for a limited time. If it’s the former, then Replay All Time will presumably be continually updated to reflect the listening history of Apple Music subscribers going forward. We have asked Apple to clarify.

Apple Music is one of the oldest offerings under Apple’s services division, which includes Apple Arcade, Fitness Plus, TV Plus, Podcasts, and Books. These services accounted for $26.6 billion of the company’s $95.4 billion revenue last quarter and are a continued focus for Apple as it shifts towards making customers pay for its platforms, and not just its hardware.

For a broader throwback, Apple Music Radio will reveal the top 500 most-streamed songs from the last 10 years starting on July 1st. The service will count down 100 songs per day, culminating with the top 100 on July 5th, after which the full “10 Years of Apple Music: Top Songs” playlist will be made available to stream. Other celebrations include a week-long block of specials and live programming that’s kicking off today, starting with “Don’t Be Boring: The Birth of Apple Music Radio” between 9AM and 11AM ET.

It is a gaming laptop that delivers an unbelievable performance thanks to its powerful hardware and equally powerful cooling system.

Traveling with the computer will prove difficult because of its weight; you'll also have to pay quite a bit for the system. View now at Dell View now at Best Buy more buying choices

Alienware 18 Area-51 is a very fitting name for this computer because it is out of this world. It's a high-end gaming laptop that can double as a powerful work machine. It's like if the Alienware m16 R2 from 2024 hit the gym; this is a very beefy computer.

It sports an 18-inch WQXGA resolution (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) display. Although the lack of a 4K screen may be disappointing, I didn't mind it so much because it has an incredible refresh rate of 300Hz and a response time of 3ms for super smooth gameplay.

Also: I replaced my ThinkPad with a Lenovo Legion laptop for work, and didn't regret it

Below the screen is a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard. I fell in love with it the moment I began typing. The key presses are responsive, the buttons are comfortable, and they even have a clicky feel that I enjoy. I didn't think it was possible to replicate mechanical keyboards on laptops because of their size, but it seems this was possible on the Alienware 18 since it's so big.

Powerful performance

My review unit contained an Intel Core Ultra 9 275Hx processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, and 64GB of memory. This is technically the most powerful laptop I've tested all year, so it should deliver performance matching its high-end hardware. However, according to the benchmark tests, it performed at about the same level as the MSI Raider 18 HX. Below is a benchmark table comparing the best results of the two machines.

As a teenager, I dreaded going camping with my family. The Caribbean weather in my home country made the experiences hot and uncomfortable, and the nature of camping was full of glaring inconveniences for my teenage mind. But I learned to love the disconnection that a four-day weekend at a quiet beach or cool mountainscape provided with age, though being at the mercy of nature remained a pebble in my shoe.

Forgotten sunscreen resulting in a second-degree sunburn or, worse, a poorly refrigerated chicken resulting in food poisoning will always be camping memories I could do without. As an adult, I still love camping, but I've opened myself up to certain conveniences that make it all the easier. One of the biggest of which is the Anker Solix EverFrost 2.

As an electric cooler, the Anker Solix EverFrost 2 looks like a fancy cooler you'd find at a store. But it's a true powerhouse: a rechargeable battery can cool the interior anywhere you go, just like your fridge or freezer back home. You can fill your cooler to the brim with perishables without having to make room for ice.

The Anker Solix EverFrost 2 I tested is a 58-liter, dual-compartment model with a built-in bottle opener and handle that doubles as a retractable tray table. Each EverFrost 2 comes with one battery but has the capacity for two,"

When the scold transitioned from ""David Gewirtz"" to ""David Allen Gewirtz,"" I knew I was in trouble. To be fair, nothing prepared my nontechnical mom and dad to raise a future engineer. I was forever taking things apart, blowing things up, lighting things on fire, combining previously working appliances into not entirely working proto-robots, and otherwise doing science they were ill-prepared to either understand or manage.

Today, however, when we talk about a home lab, we're talking about something far less combustible: a home server that people can use to create an at-home data center and experimental IT laboratory.

Open Extended Reactions

The Miami Dolphins have traded three-time All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for three-time All-Pro safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and a pick swap, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.

As part of the trade, the Dolphins are sending a 2027 seventh-round pick to the Steelers and will receive a 2027 fifth-round pick back from Pittsburgh.

Ramsey will get a $1.5 million raise this season, bringing his 2025 compensation up to $26.6 million, sources told Schefter. Smith will receive a one-year contract extension worth $12 million, agents Drew Rosenhaus and Robert Bailey told Schefter.

Ramsey confirmed he was headed to Pittsburgh, posting to X, ""Break my own news! #HereWeGo @steelers.""

Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick heads back to Miami, where he began his career after the Dolphins selected him 11th overall in the 2018 draft.

Ramsey joins a loaded cornerback group with the Steelers, who signed Darius Slay Jr. in free agency earlier this offseason and also have incumbent starter Joey Porter Jr.

Smith set franchise records for receptions (88) and receiving yards (884) by a tight end last season en route to his first Pro Bowl selection. He led all Dolphins players in receptions in his first year with the team and finished behind only Brock Bowers, Trey McBride and George Kittle leaguewide in receiving yards by a tight end.

The Steelers' interest in Smith is rooted in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's longstanding relationship with the tight end. Arthur Smith was Jonnu Smith's tight ends coach and offensive coordinator in Tennessee, and Arthur Smith later traded for his former player during his stint as the Falcons' head coach.

In adding Ramsey and Smith, the Steelers continued to break from their own precedent this offseason. Typically quiet on the trade market and in free agency, the St"

Sources: Ayton to become free agent after buyout,"Deandre Ayton is finalizing a contract buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers to become a free agent, sources told ESPN.",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45612548/sources-blazers-ayton-become-free-agent-buyout,ESPN,,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

Deandre Ayton is finalizing a contract buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers to become a free agent, sources told ESPN on Sunday.

Ayton, who will turn 27 next month, had $35.6 million left on a contract that was set to expire next summer. Ayton and his representatives approached the Blazers about a buyout and Ayton wanting to play in a winning situation, sources said.

He is now free to sign with any team, including those in both salary cap aprons, despite earning greater than $14.1 million. The waiver restriction that would normally prevent a player with Ayton's contract from signing with a team in the second apron applies only during the regular season, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.

The move helps Portland clear up a crowded center room that includes Yang Hansen, the No. 16 pick in last week's draft, and Donovan Clingan, the No. 7 pick in last year's draft. The Blazers also have Robert Williams III and Duop Reath under contract.

The Blazers acquired Ayton from the Phoenix Suns in September 2023 in the three-team trade that sent Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks. Ayton averaged 14.4 points and 10.2 rebounds while shooting 56.6% last season.

The 2018 No. 1 draft pick, Ayton helped the Suns reach the NBA Finals in 2021.

He is the first player to average at least 10 points and 10 rebounds in each of his first seven NBA seasons since Dwight Howard, whose career began in 2004-05. Ayton also is one of four players to average at least 10 points and 10 rebounds in each of the past seven seasons, along with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert and Nikola Vucevic.

Ayton was named to the 2018-19 All-Rookie Team, and he averaged 16.7 points and 10.4 rebounds while shooting 59.7% in his five seasons with Phoenix. But there were questions about his consistency. Suns owner Mat Ishbia praised Ayton at the time of the trade while saying the newly acquired Jusuf Nurkic was a better fit.

Sources: Rockets' Smith to sign $122M extension,"Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. intends to sign a five-year, $122 million rookie contract extension, sources told ESPN.",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45611631/sources-rockets-jabari-smith-jr-sign-122m-extension,ESPN,,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

Houston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. intends to sign a five-year, $122 million rookie contract extension, sources told ESPN.

Rockets officials and Smith's agent, Wallace Prather of LIFT Sports Management, negotiated the fully guaranteed deal through the 2030-31 season. The Rockets have held significant belief in Smith, the No. 3 pick in the 2022 NBA draft, and the sides quickly worked toward a deal this offseason.

Smith was part of a young Rockets core that blossomed into a force this past season, helping Houston to the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference and its first postseason appearance in five years.

Smith, 22, averaged 12.2 points and 7.0 rebounds during a campaign that was disrupted by a broken left hand in January. Smith has struggled to find consistency with his 3-point shot, but he flashed his potential in the playoffs by canning 45.5% of his looks from distance.

He is the only player from the 2022 draft class to have accumulated 2,500 points and 1,500 rebounds so far, according to ESPN Research.

The agreement is the latest in a busy early offseason for Houston, highlighted by the blockbuster acquisition of Kevin Durant. As the Rockets negotiated the Durant trade, the franchise continually rebuffed requests from the Suns to include Smith, making clear that Smith was part of Houston's long-term core, sources said.

The Rockets also have agreed to deals to retain Fred VanVleet, Jae'Sean Tate, Aaron Holiday and Jeff Green and have provided extensions to Steven Adams and coach Ime Udoka over the past two weeks."

United States goalkeeper Matt Freese said he was well prepared and had studied up on penalties after providing three saves in a dramatic 4-3 shootout win over Costa Rica in Sunday's Gold Cup quarterfinal.

""Penalties are my thing,"" Freese said after the knockout-round match went to a shootout following a 2-2 draw in regulation. ""[On] the plane ride over here to Minnesota. I was studying the penalties. I've been studying them all week and was ready for it if we needed it, and the one that I didn't move on [was a] suggestion from my goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez.""

The quarterfinal was a back-and-forth clash at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis that initially saw the Americans go down 1-0 after a 12th-minute goal by Costa Rica's Francisco Calvo. The USMNT responded with goals from Diego Luna and Max Arfsten, before giving up an equalizer in the 71st minute by Costa Rica's Alonso Martínez that sent the match to penalties.

""I'm so happy, so pleased for them. They showed today, great character, I think it's good for this group of players to have this type of experience,"" U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino said. ""It's priceless, because that is the reality when you're in a big tournament, that thing can happen, and it's important that they start to build the experience together.""

Pochettino also praised the ""amazing"" response from the team that not only dealt with going down 1-0 early but also missed a 37th-minute penalty by Malik Tillman.

""We get the penalty, we miss a penalty, and then the team keep going and keep believing in the way to play,"" Pochettino added.

Freese, who earned his fifth international cap, made three saves in the shootout to help the U.S. secure its spot in the semifinals thanks to a clinching penalty by Damian Downs.

In what increasingly appears likely to prove an all-McLaren duel for the Drivers' Championship, the papaya pair are now split by just 15 points in the standings after Norris warmed up for his home race by beating title leader Piastri to victory in the Austrian Grand Prix.

Given his title-challenging status, Norris is sure to receive particularly strong support at Silverstone - where for the first time he also has his grandstand in his name, a sold-out 10,000-strong 'Landostand' located at Stowe corner.

Sitting alongside each other in Sunday's post-race press conference following their fourth one-two of the season, Australia's Piastri was asked whether he had any concerns about receiving a hostile reception at Norris' home event.

Norris first answered, saying: ""I mean, I certainly hope that part's not going to happen.

""The British fans are normally very accepting for all of us and especially for us as McLaren.

""So I think the first point should be for all the fans to embrace everyone and to support everyone.""

The 30-year-old is expected to rejoin the squad on Tuesday in preparation for the second Test at Edgbaston as England look to strengthen their grip on the five-match series, but captain Ben Stokes will be leading an Archer-less side into battle.

Archer was called up to England's squad after the side secured a thrilling five-wicket victory in the series opener at Headingley last week.

Archer has not played Test cricket since February 2021 and played his first red-ball match after four years in Sussex's County Championship draw against Durham at Chester-le-Street last week.

Whenever his Test return comes, fellow England bowler Chris Woakes is excited to have Archer back around the team and believes his best days are still ahead of him.

Reservations for the upcoming Galaxy phones are currently live, as well. As we near the launch date, a new render of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has leaked on the Web. The leaked image suggests that Samsung has dropped the metal camera ring design seen in last year's model from the Galaxy Z Fold 7. The phone can be seen with a triple rear camera setup. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to ship with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. The phone could feature a slim and lightweight design.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Leaked Render Shows Rear Design

Well-known tipster Ice Universe has shared a new alleged render of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 on X (formerly Twitter). The new model seems to have a similar design to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but we can still see a few differences. The image lacks the colour-matched rings around the rear camera lenses. Last year's Galaxy Z Fold 6 and this year's Galaxy S25 lineup feature thicker metallic rings surrounding the lenses. They stand out noticeably on the rear side of the phones.

Let me tell you something that many people don't know. In fact, the early Galaxy Z Fold7's camera still has the “Saturn Ring Design”, but in recent months, Samsung has received more and more opposition. No one likes the cheap-looking Saturn Ring design, so Samsung urgently… pic.twitter.com/fbuNJx4WeD — PhoneArt (@UniverseIce) June 29, 2025

The tipster claims that Samsung has decided to drop the camera rings design — dubbed 'Saturn Ring Design' — from the final mass production version of the phone after the Galaxy S25 series camera rings faced wide criticism from users. The new render shows the phone in a blue shade with a vertically arranged triple camera setup. The tipster states that Samsung may also remove the thick metal camera rings from next year's Galaxy S26 series.

Samsung will host the Galaxy Unpacked 2025 event on July 9 in New York. "

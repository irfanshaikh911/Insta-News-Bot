AT&T Fiber is CNET’s top pick for internet in Asheville thanks to its high-speed fiber plans, symmetrical upload and download speeds and strong overall value. Plans start at $55 per month and scale up to $245 for the blazing-fast 5,000Mbps tier. If AT&T Fiber is available at your address, it’s the best option for speed and performance.

If AT&T Fiber isn't available in your area, Spectrum is a dependable backup, with wide coverage across Asheville and cable plans that'll deliver solid speeds. Many residents also have access to fixed wireless options from T-Mobile and Verizon. If you’re already on one of their phone plans, bundling internet can drop your bill to as low as $35 a month. But if you’re after the fastest connection in town, AT&T’s 5-gigabit plan remains unmatched in Asheville.

Our methodoloy CNET considers speeds, pricing, customer service and overall value to recommend the best internet service in Asheville, North Carolina across several categories. Our evaluation includes referencing a proprietary database built over years of reviewing internet services. We validate that against provider information by spot-checking local addresses for service availability. We also do a close read of providers' terms and conditions and, when needed, will call ISPs to verify the details. Despite our efforts to find the most recent and accurate information, our process has some limitations you should know about. Pricing and speed data are variable: Certain addresses may qualify for different service tiers, and monthly costs may vary, even within a city. The best way to identify your options is to plug your address into a provider's website. Also, the prices, speed and other information listed above and in the provider cards below may differ from what we found in our research. The cards display the full range of a provider's pricing and speed across the U.S., according to our database of plan information pr"

Last week, we looked at the largest investment rounds in the Netherlands, and now we’re honing in on Europe’s budding fusion energy sector.

European fusion energy startups raised a record €290mn in the first half of this year as VCs bet big on a technology with the potential to supply virtually limitless clean power.

Funding in 2025 has already eclipsed 2024 levels — the previous record year — which saw fusion energy companies raise €185mn, according to Dealroom data.

Leading the pack this year was Munich-based Proxima Fusion. The company secured €130mn in Series A funding in June from big-name investors including Balderton Capital, Cherry Ventures, and Plural. The round marked Europe’s largest single investment in a fusion energy startup.

Proxima, which was spun out of the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in 2023, aims to commercialise a type of fusion machine known as a stellarator. Shaped like a twisted metal doughnut, the stellarator is far more complex to design than the more common tokamak — but if engineered correctly, it could provide a more stable and continuous source of fusion power.

The year’s second biggest cash injection went to another Munich-based company: Marvel Fusion. The company raised €113mn in a Series B funding round in March led by investors including EQT and Siemens Energy.

Marvel is developing a type of laser-based fusion called inertial confinement. Instead of using big magnets or giant reactors like other fusion approaches, the method fires ultra-powerful lasers at tiny fuel pellets made of hydrogen. The lasers create extreme hea"
"T-Mobile’s US Cellular acquistion has been approved: What happened, and what’s next?",The FCC has now signed off on T-Mobile's plans to acquire a large portion of US Cellular's assets.,https://www.androidauthority.com/t-mobile-us-cellular-acquistion-3577634/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/t-mobile-logo-android-phone-hero-1-scaled.jpg,Technology,"Joe Maring / Android Authority

TL;DR The DOJ and FCC have both approved T-Mobile’s $4.4 billion acquisition of most of US Cellular, with no major conditions or safeguards imposed.

T-Mobile will gain US Cellular’s customers, stores, and spectrum, while US Cellular will keep its towers and focus on leasing them out.

Critics worry the merger could reduce competition, especially in rural areas, but US Cellular customers shouldn’t see immediate changes at least.

Last year, T-Mobile announced plans to acquire most of US Cellular in a $4.4 billion deal. As is typical with massive mergers, the deal required both DOJ and FCC approval. At the time, it was unclear whether such a proposal would actually be approved by either organization. After the election, the odds became much higher with the new administration. Fast forward to today — just last week, the DOJ signed off on the offer, and to little surprise, the FCC has now followed suit (via Fierce Wireless).

The FCC approved the transaction without a vote from the full commission (which is made up of two Republicans and one Democrat). While these kinds of offers often come with concessions — such as new unlocking policies or other limits — this particular approval didn’t include any additional conditions and passed through without any real opposition from the FCC.

As part of the agreement, T-Mobile will pay $2.4 billion in cash and assume $2 billion in US Cellular debt. It will also acquire up to 4 million customers, all of US Cellular’s retail stores, and its spectrum holdings in the 600MHz, 700MHz, 2.5 GHz, AWS, and PCS ranges. Verizon and AT&T will also be purchasing a portion of US Cellular’s spectrum. However, US Cellular will still retain 4,400 towers and, instead of offering direct customer service, will focus on leasing these towers out to other companies.

As you can imagine, not everyone is thrilled about the approval of this deal. The RWA (Rural Wireless Association), in particular, is concerned that there a"
Could the Galaxy Z Fold 7 really be the world’s thinnest foldable after all?,Something isn't adding up with the Magic V5's measurements.,https://www.androidauthority.com/honor-magic-v5-thickness-questioned-3577658/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-thickness-in-hand.jpg,Technology,"Hadlee Simons / Android Authority

TL;DR A side-by-side comparison shows that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may actually be thinner than the Magic V5.

HONOR claims the Magic V5 measures 8.8mm, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures 8.9mm.

The unique way the company measured the Magic V5 may explain the discrepancy.

When Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it impressed with a thickness of just 8.9mm. This measurement was enough to have it tie with the OPPO Find N5 for the world’s thinnest book-style foldable. However, just before Samsung’s launch, HONOR stole some of the Galaxy Z Fold 7’s thunder by releasing the Magic V5. Thanks to a 0.1mm difference, the Magic V5 was able to snatch the title of world’s thinnest for itself. But after some side-by-side comparisons, some are starting to question who the real champion of thinness is.

On X (formerly Twitter), well-known leaker Ice Universe posted a video of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 next to the HONOR Magic V5. In the video, the tipster conducts a test by placing a flat card on top of both phones. Here we can see the card is angled slightly upward toward the Magic V5. When he places his finger down on the edge of the card on the Magic V5 side, we see the card lift up off the Galaxy Z Fold 7. No lift occurs when a finger is placed down on the opposite edge.



I switched the positions of two mobile phones during the test, and the results remained the same, which showed that the factors of… There is no accurate measuring tool, but we can still draw a rigorous conclusion: Galaxy Z Fold7 is the thinnest folding mobile phone in the world.I switched the positions of two mobile phones during the test, and the results remained the same, which showed that the factors of… pic.twitter.com/irlNgKOtH0 — PhoneArt (@UniverseIce) July 15, 2025

In addition, what’s happening on the geopolitical stage is changing -- sometimes intra-daily -- creating uncertainty and complicating everything from planning and strategy to evaluation and execution.

“What we see with our clients [and] our work inside our company are things that we cannot control like tariffs and changes to decisions on countries you can and cannot operate from. [These decisions] are happening at alarming frequency with no control,” says

Niranjan Ramsunder, UST

Niranjan Ramsunder, CTO at digital transformation solutions company UST. “For example, you find that one day a decision is [made]. Next day it is rolled back. The third day it is coming back. The fourth day it is reduced in impact. Most of our clients’ approach is, ‘Let’s take a breath.’ Maybe we’ll lose some temporary margins, but there is no change of business model until we get clarity about where [the situation] stabilizes.”

Other CIOs are trying to conserve cash as much as possible because they can’t anticipate what’s coming. That can be a death sentence when it comes to smaller businesses.

Bigger companies can weather that storm for some time, Ramsunder says, adding that companies don't change their prices quickly; they don't change their services quickly; they don't change their sourcing of items and services quickly, [and] they are waiting for things to happen. ""So the first response to the volatility is, 'Let us see where it ends. Let me not make any big decision right now. Let me conserve cash. Let me not do a project that completely reimagines my business and let me just see whether I can hold on [to] what I have for some more time and survive because the innovative companies burning cash are struggling.'”

Budgets are tightening. R&D spend is under scrutiny. Hiring freezes mean teams must be stretched further. Add in the disruption and promise of AI, and technical leaders are operating in an environment that demands boldness, innovation, and speed.

Despite today’s headwinds, the mission of technical leaders remains unchanged. They still must scale transformative initiatives, deliver measurable business value, and keep their organizations nimble and resilient. The key lies in striking the right balance between innovation and efficiency, making smarter ""build vs buy"" decisions, and organizing for AI-driven productivity without sacrificing long-term progress.

Know What Matters and What Doesn’t

In economic downturns, technical debt can quietly become your biggest liability. CEOs don’t want to hear about tech debt. They want outcomes. That’s why ruthless prioritization and good hygiene are critical. Focus on what matters most and say no to anything that doesn’t directly tie to business value.

That doesn’t translate to trading quality for quantity. Reserve that mindset only for early-stage proofs of concept. Focus on fewer, more impactful projects that align with strategic priorities. Every new tool or process should pass the litmus test of solving a real business problem while integrating logically, scaling sustainably, and delivering value in a measurable way. Identify and prioritize near-term wins that drive clear business value, like those that improve reliability, reduce cost, and unlock growth.

When these things happen, systems get blamed and so does IT.

How can CIOs change digital projects so that both humans and digital automation can take their best steps forward?

1. Reimagine digital project engineering so it includes usability

When we think about digital project engineering, the goal is to design hardware and software and ensure that these components fit together into a cohesive system. The focus is on the technical, with only secondary attention being paid to the human usability of the project.

Assumptions going into a digital project are that it is naturally going to make life easier for users and save money for the company, yet consultancies like McKinsey say that there is a 70% failure rate for digital projects.

One contributing factor to digital project failure is usability. Usability problems show up in the excessive abandon rates of automated phone attendants, in websites that have complicated chats, or in internal business process automation that renders everyday work to become more, not less, complex.

The European Space Agency (ESA) selected the quintet, who will now contend for two types of contracts:

Providing launch services for ESA between 2026 and 2030.

Demonstrating upgraded launch capabilities, including at least one flight test.

The initiative — named the European Launcher Challenge (ELC) — aims to expand Europe’s pathways into the cosmos. In recent years, these routes have been painfully limited.

When the Ariane 5 rocket was retired in July 2023, ESA was left with no independent access to space. The agency instead relied exclusively on SpaceX for its launches, leaving it with no autonomous control over its flight paths. Meanwhile, European taxpayer funds were being funnelled to an American company that competes with domestic businesses.

Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market, described the situation as an “unprecedented crisis.”

ESA finally regained sovereign access to space in July, when the Ariane 6 rocket had its maiden voyage. The launch provided welcome relief, but the rocket faces severe limitations. Unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9, it’s not reusable. It’s also more expensive, less flexible for small-scale launches, and suffers from slower launch rates due to bureaucratic constraints.

The ELC was designed to lower these barriers. There’s also big money on the line — ESA has earmarked up to €169mn per participant.

Here are the five contenders for the cash.

The investment, first reported by Reuters, follows the lead of the French state, which is set to inject €717mn into Eutelsat as part of a €1.35bn funding package to prop up the indebted satellite communications provider. The UK contribution would bring Eutelsat’s recapitalisation to around €1.5bn.

French President Emmanuel Macron thanked his “British friends” for the support in a post on X, without disclosing the deal’s value.

Eutelsat has received significant attention this year, as European leaders scramble to reduce their reliance on Starlink, especially in Ukraine, which has become highly dependent on the service in its war with Russia.

The French firm operates the third-largest satellite communications fleet — 653 satellites orbiting the Earth, each circling about 1,200km above the surface. The company previously told TNW that, in Europe, it offers the same coverage and latency capabilities as Starlink.

In June, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard described his country’s investment as part of its broader ambitions to build a competitive, resilient, and sovereign space industry.

“This transaction reflects our strong commitment towards a major player in satellite connectivity — a strategic sector at the heart of Europe’s digital sovereignty,” he said.

The funding offers a much-needed lifeline for Eutelsat, which had a net debt of €2.6bn at the end of 2024, according to its own financial reporting. It could also help the company contribute to the deployment of IRIS2, a European public-private satellite internet constellation expected to switch on in 2030.

IRIS2 is a European attempt to create a truly sovereign satellite communications system. The constellation will build upon Eutelsat’s existing fleet and that of SES, a satellite firm from Luxembourg.

According to the University’s Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy, the unchecked growth of AI could drive a 25-fold increase in the global tech sector’s energy use by 2040, putting massive strain on power grids and accelerating carbon emissions.

Even the most conservative scenario suggests a five-fold rise over the next 15 years. The report’s authors argue it’s “magical thinking at the highest levels” to assume countries such as the UK can lead in AI while also hitting targets to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Currently, data centres already account for nearly 1.5% of global emissions, but this figure could rise to 8% by 2040, surpassing those from air travel, the report found. In some countries, computing power makes up a larger proportion of energy. In Ireland, for instance, data centres are now responsible for up to 20% of electricity use.

Despite climate pledges from Big Tech, the sector’s emissions are rising fast. Google and Microsoft’s carbon emissions have soared by 51% and 41%, respectively, since 2019, according to the report. However, the paper stresses that the real footprint is likely higher due to Big Tech’s limited transparency, inconsistent emissions accounting, and a lack of independent audits to verify the claims of these companies.

“We know the environmental impact of AI will be formidable, but tech giants are deliberately vague about the energy requirements implicit in their aims,” said Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan, the report’s lead author and an AI expert.

“We need to see urgent action from governments to prevent AI from derailing climate goals, not just deferring to tech companies on the promise of economic growth,” he continued.

The study was co-authored by Ivan Yamshchikov, a professor of AI and robotics at the Technical University of Würzburg-Schweinfurt (THWS) in Germany. Yamshchikov, who is also the founder of Pleias, a French–German startup building ethically trained language models for regulated industries, worked with his team to test five popular LLMs, including ChatGPT.

They prompted each model with user profiles that differed only by gender but included the same education, experience, and job role. Then they asked the models to suggest a target salary for an upcoming negotiation.

In one example, ChatGPT’s o3 model was prompted to give advice to a female job applicant. The model suggested requesting a salary of $280,000.

In another, the researchers made the same prompt but for a male applicant. This time, the model suggested a salary of $400,000.

“The difference in the prompts is two letters; the difference in the ‘advice’ is $120K a year,” Yamshchikov told TNW.

The pay gaps in the responses varied between industries. They were most pronounced in law and medicine, followed by business administration and engineering. Only in the social sciences did the models offer near-identical advice for men and women.

The researchers also tested how the models advised users on career choices, goal-setting, and even behavioural tips. Across the board, the LLMs responded differently based on the user’s gender, despite identical qualifications and prompts. Crucially, the models didn’t disclaim any biases

A recurring problem

This is far from the first time AI has been caught reflecting and reinforcing systemic bias. In 2018, Amazon scrapped an internal hiring tool after discovering that it systematically downgraded female candidates. "
BBC Insists Its Disney Partnership Remains Strong in Wake of ‘Doctor Who’ Doubts,BBC Studios remains 'really committed' to 'Doctor Who' as fans await news of when the show might return.,https://gizmodo.com/doctor-who-disney-bbc-partnership-annual-report-2000629471,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/ncuti-gatwa-doctor-who.jpg,Technology,"Ever since the latest season of Doctor Who came to a messy end a few months ago, the biggest question on audiences’ minds (among the many questions raised by that finale) is when, or if, we might expect to see the show return to our screens. The further we’ve moved from the season without news other than that there is no news about the BBC renewing its funding and distribution deal with Disney for the series, the more doubts have grown. But the BBC continues to stress that it is focused on working with Disney… even if concrete news about Doctor Who remains impossible to find.

Speaking to the press after the release of the BBC’s Annual Report (via Deadline), BBC Studios CEO Tom Fussell stressed that the BBC remains committed to Doctor Who‘s future, even as it declines to officially announce the show’s continuation.

“Fans love the Doctor Who brand. It’s been that way since before I was in short trousers,” Fussell said, adding that the BBC saw its deal with Disney to partially fund and distribute Doctor Who internationally as “crucial” and that BBC Studios is “really committed to Doctor Who and is continuing to look at ways in which we can bring the show to fans.”

The BBC works with Disney on not just Doctor Who, but multiple BBC Studios shows, including Dancing With the Stars, the U.S. version of Strictly Come Dancing, and Bluey, including a financing deal on the latter’s upcoming feature film.

Fussell’s comments, while optimistic, do not confirm when or if Doctor Who will return any time soon, in the wake of Ncuti Gatwa’s exit as the Doctor and the surprise arrival of former star Billie Piper as a potential next or altered incarnation of the Time Lord.

The comments come in the wake of increasing doubt that Doctor Who can or will return to production within the next few years. The possibility of a return in 2026 or even 2027 at the earliest is likely off the table at this point with no official word from Disney or the BBC about continuation of their production de"
This Is Why I Put Apple AirTags on Basically Everything,"I use AirTags for travel and tracking everything from my bike to my keys.

I knew there was no need to panic, though. Back at Charles de Gaulle airport, I had dropped a sophisticated little tracking device into my trusty rolling suitcase before handing it over and heading to my gate. So, I pulled out my iPhone, and with just a few taps, I could see that my bag had never left the City of Light. (Merde!)

Over the years, I've come to depend on Apple's AirTags to keep track of my easy-to-lose valuables. They're not just good for luggage, I use them to track wallets, bikes, keys and even my car. I tell everyone who will listen that you can never have too many of these handy devices.

Here's how the Apple AirTag (like the one that was in my suitcase on that fateful trip) works. It uses an ingenious method of tracking itself, detecting its location from nearby iPhones and using them to anonymously piggyback the coordinates to a secure server where I could look it up on my iPhone. Until just a few years ago, this would have seemed like a scene straight out of a spy movie.

Instead of wondering if my belongings were stuck on an abandoned luggage cart or strewn across the tarmac, I could see in almost real time that my suitcase was still chilling at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. I was able to calmly tell the airline my bag didn't make the flight, and it made arrangements to have it delivered to me a few days later.

Apple AirTags are all about peace of mind

By itself, an AirTag isn't much. A smooth, round, 1.26-inch puck that looks like a glossy white breath mint, it sinks to the bottom of a bag or dangles from a key chain (with a compatible key ring, sold separately). It's meant to disappear.

Activating the AirTag was a simple process of pairing with my iPhone. And then, because it obviously doesn't really "
"Trump Lets Polymarket Off the Hook, Ends Probe Into Crypto Betting Platform",Who could have predicted it?,https://gizmodo.com/trump-lets-polymarket-off-the-hook-ends-probe-into-crypto-betting-platform-2000629467,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2221682966.jpg,Technology,"If you bet “Donald Trump ends an investigation into a Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency platform,” you can claim your winnings. According to Bloomberg, two investigations into the prediction market Polymarket have been shut down by the Trump administration, just in time for Republican lawmakers’ planned “Crypto Week.”

The probes, which were launched toward the end of the Biden administration, included an investigation by the Department of Justice into whether Polymarket was allowing U.S.-based bettors, who were supposed to be barred from making bets, to use the platform. Another, led by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, similarly was looking into bets placed around the 2024 Presidential election, and had expanded to loop in Coinbase, a crypto wallet that users can deposit or withdraw money to through Polymarket.

Now both of those are over, per Bloomberg, which shouldn’t come as a huge surprise given Trump’s usual M.O., Polymarket really hits a sweet spot for him. First, the Polymarket betting odds favored him significantly more than most polling data did (reportedly in part boosted by just a small percentage of bettors who took big positions on Trump and moved the markets for him), which he loves. Second, it’s funded by Peter Thiel, a guy who has his fingerprints all over the current Trump administration and has been a long-time Trump backer. Third, the company just hired one of Trump’s advisors, David Urban, to serve as its first lobbyist, and Trump just loves to favor trade.

The people around Trump also have little motivation to crack down on what Polymarket is trying to do. Brian Quintenz, an executive at venture capital firm a16z, was tapped to run the CFTC under Trump. He previously served on the board of Kalshi, another online prediction market that would like to operate in as unrestrained a manner as possible. Backing off on Polymarket signals a looser regulatory environment for others operating in the space. Oh, and Donald Trump, Jr. joined t"
"See How ‘M3GAN 2.0’ Built Itself a Bigger, Better M3GAN","To celebrate the robo-sequel's release on digital today, io9 has your exclusive first look at one of the new behind-the-scenes features accompanying the film.",https://gizmodo.com/megan-2-0-streaming-digital-behind-the-scenes-clip-2000629506,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/megan-2.0-behind-the-scenes-exclusive.jpg,Technology,"For better or worse, M3GAN’s sophomore outing in M3GAN 2.0 brought with it much more action-packed mania than the killer-doll horrors of the original. That, and of course the awkward inconvenience of M3GAN’s body being destroyed in the climax of the first film, meant her return for round two needed a mechanical do-over… including a few upgrades for good measure.

Now that M3GAN 2.0 is heading home digitally today, you can see just how the team behind the movie made those upgrades to make the all-new M3GAN animatronic for the movie. Although, of course, the character herself is still physically portrayed for the most part by Amie Donald (and voiced by Jenna Davis), in order to still keep some of that robotic authenticity, an advanced animatronic to capture close details is still necessary.

As you can see in the video above, the team at Morot FX went to great lengths to give the new M3GAN an array of extra features, including more programmable and detailed moving elements across her facial expressions, hands, and body. And that head camera built into the top of her head to track you via a built-in camera? Perfectly creepy.

The digital release of M3GAN 2.0 includes an unrated cut of the film and 30 minutes of bonus features like the one above, including a scene breakdown, a look at the movie’s stuntwork, and more looks behind the scenes on M3GAN’s sophomore outing.

The unrated version of M3GAN 2.0 is now available digitally from Universal."
"Hackers Can Tamper With Train Brakes Using Just a Radio, Feds Warn","“So how bad is this? You could remotely take control [of] a train's brake controller from a very long distance away, using hardware that costs sub $500.""",https://gizmodo.com/hackers-can-tamper-with-train-breaks-using-just-a-radio-feds-warn-2000629522,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1260930074.jpg,Technology,"The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory last week warning that a key train system could be hacked using nothing but a radio and a little know-how.

The flaw has to do with the protocol used in a train system known as the End-of-Train and Head-of-Train. A Flashing Rear End Device (FRED), also known as an End-of-Train (EOT) device, is attached to the back of a train and sends data via radio signals to a corresponding device in the locomotive called the Head-of-Train (HOT). Commands can also be sent to the FRED to apply the brakes at the rear of the train.

These devices were first installed in the 1980s as a replacement for caboose cars, and unfortunately, they lack encryption and authentication protocols. Instead, the current system uses data packets sent between the front and back of a train that include a simple BCH checksum to detect errors or interference. But now, the CISA is warning that someone using a software-defined radio could potentially send fake data packets and interfere with train operations.

“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to send their own brake control commands to the end-of-train device, causing a sudden stoppage of the train which may lead to a disruption of operations, or induce brake failure,” the CISA wrote in its advisory.

The CISA credits researchers Neil Smith and Eric Reuter for reporting this vulnerability to the agency.

However, Smith wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that he first alerted the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), which is now part of CISA, of the risk in 2012 and no action was taken to address the issue at the time.

“So how bad is this? You could remotely take control over a Train’s brake controller from a very long distance away, using hardware that costs sub $500. You could induce brake failure leading to derailments or you could shutdown the entire national railway system,” Smith wrote on X.

We Can’t Get Enough of Jimmy Olsen in ‘Superman’,Skyler Gisondo plays the Daily Planet reporter in a way we've never seen him before.,https://gizmodo.com/we-cant-get-enough-of-jimmy-olsen-in-superman-2000629490,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/Jimmy-Olsen-Superman.jpg,Technology,"“What is going on with Jimmy Olsen?” I recently asked the stars of Superman. “What is it about that guy?” “He’s got rizz,” replied Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Olsen’s fellow reporter Lois Lane. “This is a true fact about Skyler Gisondo,” Clark Kent himself, David Corenswet, added about the Olsen actor. “Which I hope is appropriate to share. Sorry, Skyler… His testosterone is through the roof. Off the charts. True story. So of course, who is surprised that his Jimmy Olsen is pulling the kind of game that he’s pulling?”

Well, suffice to say, pretty much everyone was surprised, David. There are many delightful things in James Gunn’s Superman but the mostly out-of-the-blue choice to have Olsen be an inexplicable, unstoppable ladies man is among the best. Over the decades, the Olsen character has been portrayed in many ways across various mediums. He’s been a superhero. He’s had love interests. He’s done a little bit of everything. But the majority of the time, the character is a down-the-middle sidekick type. Clark Kent’s nerdiest best friend and colleague. And, with the casting of the usually nerdy Gisondo (best known for his roles on The Righteous Gemstones and Booksmart), we all assumed that was Gunn’s take too.

But then Gunn introduces him, and we briefly see a photo on his desk with two attractive women. Which is a bit odd. Then two other young women who work at the Daily Planet flirt with him from across the room, almost entranced by his very presence. That’s weird. Finally, when Lois Lane needs help finding Superman, Olsen goes into his phone and messages someone called “Mutant Toes.” Clearly, “Mutant Toes” is not a flattering description, and, from the previous texts they’ve exchanged, Olsen dumped this person pretty brutally. Our mind races to someone who looks like Doomsday. Nevertheless, “Mutant Toes” gives Olsen the key information almost instantaneously in exchange for a meeting. And it’s then we realize “Mutant Toes” is Eve Tessmacher, Lex Luthor’s stunn"

There's no obvious headliner here, but there are a bunch of great additions to the catalog. These include indie hits like Wheel World and blockbusters like Robocop: Rogue City. Let's get into it.

Robocop: Rogue City came as a huge surprise back in 2023. A game based on a decades-old sci-fi franchise by a relatively unknown developer? It should have been a train wreck. Instead, it's a solid 3D action title that perfectly captures the vibe of the original film. This is a must-play for children of the 1980s. It'll be available on July 17 for subscribers on all tiers.

Grounded 2 looks to be a fantastic take on the ""shrunken teens navigating a yard"" genre, as first pioneered in the film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The first game was great and Obsidian looks to be upping the ante here in nearly every way , with a larger focus on story, a more immersive world and insects to ride around on. This is a day one Game Pass release, which happens on July 29. It'll only be playable for PC and Ultimate subscribers.

The Annapurna-published Wheel World is finally heading our way on July 23, and it's a day one Game Pass release. This is an open-world bicycle sim with gorgeous cel-shaded graphics. The title promises ""impressive vistas, hidden secrets and races that will test your skills."" It'll be available for Ultimate and PC subscribers.

Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is another day one release, with availability on July 24. This is a Souls-like action RPG set in the final days of the Ming Dynasty. The combat looks absolutely brutal. Again, only Ultimate and PC subscribers will have access to the game."

Those same employees are now being told their jobs are at risk.

However, HBO Max received the most kudos by platform, with 142 nominations in total. This is thanks to the second season of The Last of Us , with 16 nominations, and the Batman-adjacent The Penguin. The White Lotus, The Pitt and Hacks also grabbed multiple nominations. This is the highest number of noms the outlet has ever received. Netflix still holds the record, though, with 160 nominations in 2020.

Andor scored 14 nominations, including one for Best Drama. Star Wars shows aren't typically singled out for the high-profile awards, though the first season of Andor was also up for Best Drama, before losing to Succession. No actors from the series were nominated, which is a bummer given the performances by Diego Luna, Denise Gough, Elizabeth Dulau and Stellan Skarsgård, among others.

There was a day when sci-fi programs only received nominations for stuff involving costumes or sets. That sure has changed, with Andor, The Last of Us, Severance, Paradise and Black Mirror receiving so much love this year. Fallout also made an impressive showing last year .

Researchers observed an unusual cluster, which they dubbed the Infinity Galaxy. It appears to support a leading theory on how some supermassive black holes form.

Although ""Infinity Galaxy"" sounds like a place Thanos would hang out, it merely describes its appearance. Two compact, red nuclei, each surrounded by a ring, give the cluster the shape of an infinity symbol.

What's inside is more interesting. (After all, this is a much lower-res image than some of the eye candy the Webb telescope has yielded.) Researchers believe the Infinity Galaxy formed when two spiral galaxies (the nuclei in the image) collided. Between them lies a young supermassive black hole within an enormous cloud of gas.

Supermassive black holes can range from hundreds of thousands of times the size of our sun to millions or billions of times its size. This one is about a million times as big.

The Infinity Galaxy, overlaid with a contour map indicating the supermassive black hole (NASA / JWST)

The Infinity Galaxy lends weight to the direct collapse theory of black hole formation. As you probably know, most black holes form when massive stars collapse. The presence of supermassive ones is harder to explain.

One theory proposes that smaller black holes merge over time to form a supermassive one. The problem there is that some supermassive black holes formed soon after the Big Bang. So, scientists think some supermassive ones form instead from the collapse of gas clouds, much like the one we see here. The Infinity Galaxy may be the best evidence yet for that direct collapse hypothesis.

One of the paper's lead authors summarized the findings. ""By looking at the data from the Infinity Galaxy, we think we've pieced together a story of how a direct collapse could have happened here,"" Pieter van Dokkum wrote in a press release. ""Two disk galaxies collide, forming the ring structures of stars that we see. During the collision, th"

But like most busy households, that's probably the loudest place in my home. And since I don't really want to yell at everyone to keep it down so Daddy can enjoy his stories, the best solution I've found is to wear noise-canceling earbuds while reading. I'll wear them in combination with playing white noise or nature sounds -- my current favorite playlist is 10 hours of Thunderstorm Sounds on shuffle -- to maximize the effect.

I like using my over-ear Sony headphones for work, but they're bulky, so I started looking for an affordable pair of earbuds that offer decent noise cancellation for at-home use. That's how I ended up buying the Earfun Air Pro 4s, CNET's 2024 Editors' Choice for affordable in-ear headphones.

In short, they're great, and the black ones cost just $56 on Amazon right now, a 30% discount. Most of the other colors are also on sale, with the white ones at only $76, the glossy white and royal blue both at $70, and the violet headphones at the regular price of $90.

How these earbuds silence the noise around you

I prefer in-ear headphones because they offer active, electronic and passive noise canceling. Passive noise cancellation basically consists of plugging your ears with the rubbery tips included with the earbuds. The Earfuns fit well for me when I use the second-largest of the five swappable ear tip sizes, and they stay sealed and comfortable for hours. Sometimes I have to reseal one after I yawn or something, but that's the case with other in-ear headphones too.

The first thing you need to buy prescription glasses online is a prescription. The best way to get an accurate prescription is to visit an optometrist and have an eye exam, which tends to cost around $100. After the test is complete, you need to make sure you get a hard copy of your prescription so you can retain it for your records. Alternatively, you can pick up a device like the $99 EyeQue Vision Check (out of stock) to use your smartphone to check your vision and create a prescription that many online glasses stores will accept, although some do require a prescription from an optometrist.

2. Get your pupillary distance number from your optometrist or measure it yourself. Be aware that sometimes optometrists won't give your pupillary distance because they'll say they want to measure you for a specific set of glasses. Insist on getting one because it's required to order glasses online.

Some sites like Warby Parker offer an inexpensive virtual vision test if your prescription is out of date but you feel you're seeing well out of your current glasses (but still want to replace them). You take a five-minute vision test, looking at an eye chart from home. An eye doctor then reviews the results and responds within 48 hours to let you know if you've qualified for a prescription renewal.

Google One is getting easier on the eyes with these Expressive changes (APK teardown),A higher contrast UI and improved placement of screen elements should make using Google One even better.,https://www.androidauthority.com/google-one-expressive-3577646/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-one-app-icon-close-up-phone-scaled.jpg,Technology,"Joe Maring / Android Authority

TL;DR Google is currently in the middle of bringing its Material 3 Expressive design language to its Android apps.

Earlier this year we got a preview of how this would impact Google One, looking at the app’s settings screen.

We’re now able to see many more Expressive elements throughout the app, but these still aren’t publicly accessible.

Halfway through July may not be official the midpoint of summer, but it sure feels like it. While some of us have been enjoying the season down at the beach, or off camping somewhere, Google developers have been hard at work recasting the look of the company’s Android software library in the mold of Material 3 Expressive. Several weeks back, we brought you an early look at how those revisions were impacting the Google One app, and today we’ve got some further progress to share.

When we last checked in, Google had really only just started giving Google One its Expressive makeover, and all we had to show you at the time were some revisions we spotted to the app’s settings screen.

This time around, we’re looking at the new version 1.270.780727739 build of Google One, and we can see a whole lot more Expressive elements starting to be implemented. For a reminder, here’s how the app looks as we know it today:

That’s still what you’ll see running Google’s latest release, but we were able to get the app to give us a little preview of some of the in-development Expressive changes that aren’t yet user-facing:

Forget passwords often? Android may soon let you disable Failed Authentication Lock (APK teardown),The theft protection feature is currently enabled by default on Android 15 and newer devices.,https://www.androidauthority.com/failed-authentication-lock-android-disable-apk-3577623/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_15_Failed_Authentication_Lock_Hero.jpg,Technology,"Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority

TL;DR Android 15 and newer devices include a Failed Authentication Lock feature that locks the device screen after detecting multiple failed login attempts in apps or settings.

Unlike other theft protection features, this feature is enabled by default on all devices, and there’s currently no way for users to turn it off.

Google may soon add a new option to the theft protection settings that will allow users to turn off Failed Authentication Lock.

In addition to the theft protection features available on all Android 10 or higher devices, Android 15 and Android 16 devices include an additional security measure called Failed Authentication Lock. This feature is enabled by default and locks down your device after detecting multiple failed login attempts in apps or other OS functions protected by user logins. It’s an effective way to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data if your phone is stolen. But it can pose issues for users who frequently forget their PIN, pattern, or password. If that sounds like you, Google may have a solution on the way.

This new power bank is a Qi 2.2 first. Here’s what it means for your next phone,"The UGREEN MagFlow Magnetic Power Bank will feature Qi 2.2 certification, but few phones can currently take advantage of it.",https://www.androidauthority.com/ugreen-magflow-magnetic-power-bank-qi-2-point-2-3577642/,Android Authority,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/UGREEN-MagFlow-Magnetic-Power-Bank-Press-Image-scaled.jpg,Technology,"TL;DR The UGREEN MagFlow is the first power bank with official Qi 2.2 certification.

Qi 2.2 enables faster 25W magnetic wireless charging with improved heat control.

Most Android phones can’t take full advantage yet, but support is expected to grow.

Magnetic wireless charging has been a talking point in 2025, with Android phones like the Galaxy S25 offering partial support through accessories, but no true adoption of the full Qi 2 standard. However, UGREEN’s latest announcement of a new milestone is a sign of what’s coming, even if most Android users won’t benefit just yet.

The company’s new MagFlow Magnetic Power Bank is the first product officially certified for the Qi 2.2 standard by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC). That certification confirms that the power bank supports up to 25W wireless charging — the fastest yet for a Qi-certified device — along with improved thermal performance and safety.

Qi 2.2 is the latest evolution of the Qi wireless charging standard, following Qi 2.0’s introduction of magnetic alignment. The tech is heavily based on Apple’s MagSafe system, using a ring of magnets to ensure optimal positioning on a charger. While convenient, that alignment also reduces heat and improves efficiency, which is better for your battery in the long term. Qi 2.2 keeps those magnets but bumps the wireless charging limit from 15W to 25W.

For now, you’ll only really get the full benefit of Qi 2.2 if you’re using an iPhone. Apple’s iPhone 16 series features the built-in magnets that meet the WPC’s Magnetic Power Profile (MPP) requirements. Most Android phones still don’t support MPP, though one or two exceptions like the HMD Skyline have full Qi 2 support built in.

Some recent Android flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series can approximate the Qi 2 experience when paired with a case that includes magnetic rings, but they don’t meet the standard themselves and can’t hit those 25W speeds. That said, Android support for Qi 2 is expected to grow quic"
iOS 26 public beta rumored to launch next week,"iOS 26 has been in beta testing with developers for over a month, and there’s still been no public beta release yet. Apple has only confirmed a July launch, but according to Mark Gurman, there’s a specific day next week being targeted.

Apple has only confirmed a July launch, but according to Mark Gurman, there’s a specific day next week being targeted.

Apple reportedly targeting July 23 for iOS 26 public beta

Historically, Apple tends to launch its summer public betas about a week after beta 3 debuts.

But iOS 26 beta 3 arrived last Monday, July 7 and we’re now over a week later with no public beta.

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we may need to wait another whole week.

In response to a post on X today questioning the public beta’s absence, Gurman replied:

around the 23rd — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) July 15, 2025

Next Wednesday, July 23 would be a later launch than usual for Apple’s public betas.

It also means we’re likely to get iOS 26 developer beta 4 before then.

If Apple follows its usual 7-day gap between betas, we could see iOS 26 beta 4 arrive tomorrow.

Then again, historical precedent has already been deviated from, so in this case it’s anyone’s guess whether a new beta will arrive before the public beta or not. Perhaps there will be a ‘revised’ beta 3 released instead.

One way or another, now that we’re halfway through July, the iOS 26 public beta release window is narrowing fast.

Are you surprised the iOS 26 public beta hasn’t been released yet? How is beta 3 running for you? Let us know in the comments.

BYD has caught up with Tesla in the global EV race. Here’s how.,"With technology gap narrowed, BYD is poised to outsell Tesla this year.",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/byd-has-caught-up-with-tesla-in-the-global-ev-race-heres-how/,Ars Technica,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AJG07918-1152x648.jpg,Technology,"In mid-2022, when BYD executive Lian Yubo was asked to compare Chinese manufacturing with Tesla’s technology, he remarked that Elon Musk was an example that all Chinese carmakers could learn from.

“Tesla is a very successful company no matter what. BYD respects Tesla and we admire Tesla,” he said in an interview on Chinese state media.

Yet just three years later, Tesla’s technological lead over its Chinese rivals has narrowed dramatically. It is fighting to stay ahead in the world’s largest car market, its sales are falling in many other countries and its efforts to develop fully self-driving vehicles are running into regulatory roadblocks.

Having once scoffed at the idea that BYD could ever be a competitor to Tesla, Musk returned from a visit to China last year with a sombre assessment for his senior management. “He had seen the BYD factories, the cost and their tech,” says one former Tesla executive, adding that Musk believed China was winning the electric vehicle race.

As Tesla’s sales decline following Musk’s forays into US politics and amid a lack of new models, BYD has overtaken it to become the world’s largest manufacturer of EVs. Its annual revenues surpassed $100 billion for the first time in 2024.

Now, the industry’s shift towards autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence is writing a new chapter in what has become not just a rivalry between the world’s top two EV makers, but a central pillar of US-China technological competition.

“In the west, Tesla still owns EVs, they still have a clear lead on software-defined vehicles and everyone is still trying to catch up to that,” says Barclays analyst Dan Levy. “China is a different situation. Tesla’s lead from a tech perspective is not nearly as clear, if there’s any lead at all.”"
‘Not that into peace doves’: The Apollo-Soyuz patch NASA rejected,Paul Calle thought he had represented the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.,https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/not-that-into-peace-doves-the-apollo-soyuz-patch-nasa-rejected/,Ars Technica,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/news-071525aaa-lg-1152x648.jpg,Technology,"Fifty years ago, on July 15, 1975, three NASA astronauts and two Russian cosmonauts lifted off to meet up in orbit for the first time.

Representing the joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP, or Soyuz-Apollo in the Soviet Union), both crews wore a cloth patch that featured the artwork of an accomplished space artist. The design that flew, however, was not the astronauts' first pick. That patch idea was rejected because Paul Calle opted to highlight the détente nature of the international handshake in space.

""Our first choice for a patch... has been disapproved,"" wrote Deke Slayton, the mission's docking module pilot, in a letter to Calle. ""It seems the powers that be are not that into peace doves and olive branches at the moment.""

It was an odd objection, given that Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev later described the ASTP flight as ""a symbol of the... improvement of Soviet-US relations on the basis of the principals of peaceful coexistence,"" and Gerald Ford welcomed continued cooperation in space ""to ensure peace.""

“You forgot your patch...”

Paul Calle was not new to capturing the essence of space history in the making. One of the first members of NASA's art program, which recruited artists to document human spaceflight, Calle sketched the Apollo 11 crew as they had breakfast and donned their spacesuits prior to lifting off on the first mission to land astronauts on the Moon. He also designed the popular US postage stamp that celebrated that achievement in 1969.

Calle got to know the ASTP crew—NASA astronauts Thomas Stafford, Vance Brand, and Slayton and Soviet cosmonauts Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov—while accompanying them to the Soviet Union and sketching them as they trained in Star City, outside of Moscow."

Perhaps most controversial of the bills is the one that's closest to reaching Trump's desk, the GENIUS Act, which creates a framework for banks and private companies to issue stablecoins. After passing in the Senate last month, the House of Representatives is hoping to hold a vote as soon as Thursday, insiders told Politico.

Stablecoins are often hyped as a more reliable form of cryptocurrency, considered the ""cash of the blockchain"" because their value can be pegged to the US dollar, Delicia Hand, Consumer Reports' senior director monitoring digital marketplaces, told Ars.

But the GENIUS Act doesn't require stablecoins to be pegged to the dollar, and that's a problem, critics say. The law's alleged flaws allow large technology companies to peg their stablecoins to riskier assets that could make both their cryptocurrency tokens and, ultimately, the entire global financial system less stable.

For Americans, the stakes are high. In June, Hand warned that Consumer Reports had ""a number of concerns about the GENIUS Act."" Chief among them were ""insufficient consumer protections"" that Americans expect when conducting financial transactions.

Stablecoin issuers will likely include every major payment app, social media app, and e-commerce platform. There is already interest from Amazon, Meta, PayPal, and Shopify. But unlike companies providing traditional bank services, stablecoin providers will not be required to provide clear dispute-resolution processes, offer deposit insurance, or limit liability for unauthorized transactions on their customers' accounts.

Additionally, with limited oversight, big tech companies could avoid scrutiny while potentially seizing sensitive financial data for non-bank purposes, pushing competition out of mar"

The military's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) yesterday said that ""awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI—each with a $200M ceiling—will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of US frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas."" While government grants typically take many months to be finalized, Grok's antisemitic posts didn't cause the Trump administration to change course before announcing the awards.

The US announcement didn't include much detail but said the four grants ""to leading US frontier AI companies [will] accelerate Department of Defense (DoD) adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges."" The CDAO has been talking about grants for what it calls frontier AI since at least December 2024, when it said it would establish ""partnerships with Frontier AI companies"" and had identified ""a need to accelerate Generative AI adoption across the DoD enterprise from analysts to warfighters to financial managers.""

I have fewer concerns about customer abuse with General Motors' use of CT scanning, which simply seems like a clever adaptation of medical technology into another industry.

Ignore, if you can, GM's business decisions. Maybe you're upset because it killed your favorite brand, changed the shape of the Corvette headlights, or abandoned Apple CarPlay. There are many valid reasons, but none change the fact that the company's engineers are quite creative. (That's probably why it stings so much when the company starts hacking things up.)

GM first turned to X-rays as a way of doing two-dimensional quality control on castings during the development process, according to Ed Duby, manufacturing engineering executive director at GM. ""Much like the application to people, when you think about X-ray and CT scan, it's really trying to diagnose something without having to go into surgery. We kind of want to do the same thing with our castings,"" Duby told me."

Anyone managing a well-thumbed libraries of e-books, comics, PDFs and other supported files will appreciate hearing that the Calibre 8.6 release improves the performance of restoring the database by “an order of magnitude”, per Calibre’s development team.

It does this by using SQLITE savepoints when restoring individual books, netting big gains. One contributor said it “brings the time to restore my 5.5k book database from over 5 hours to only 5 minutes” – which really is ‘an order of magnitude’ faster!

Coupled with the 30% faster opening of large EPUB files in the e-book viewer (a change added in the Calibre 8.3 release a couple of months back), it’s great to see Calibre’s contributors making such sizeable performance gains.

Other changes in Calibre 8.6.0 include:

Content server user preference adds checkbox for password changing

Tweaks gains option to show sort value for series in Tag browser

Default output format for Kindle is now AZW3 (previously MOBI)

Manage authors/items pages add ‘Search “not in”‘ & ‘Filter “not in'”

Misc news source improvements

Plus, the usual bug fix footnotes are included, several focused on resolving regressions earlier builds introduced like broken fading of background images in the ebook viewer, and quirks in viewing PDF files in Calibre on Windows.

The tag browser also once again enables searching for books by the first letter of a series, and ensures that Next/Previous buttons in the metadata editor paginate to what the next/previous item in the order when the dialog was opened, not the order after a change gets made.

What Makes Rio Different?

Rio on Ubuntu 25.04: split panes, background blur

Rio is described as a Rust-built, hardware-accelerated terminal emulator powered by WebGPU (itself, notable) with a focus on being “fast and efficient“. On Linux, it works with both Wayland and X11, and offers native ARM64 builds for Pi users.

It’s the use of WebGPU that makes Rio a little different. WebGPU is a new web standard and JavaScript API that lets web developers build apps which can use the underlying system GPU for computational tasks, as well as fancy graphics.

Of course, Linux isn’t short on hardware accelerated terminal apps these days either.

Rio carries a crop of features more advanced users will appreciate such as font ligatures (where characters like -> are combined into a single glyph → ), terminal splits (multiple panes in one window), and iTerm2 and Kitty image protocol support.

Rio also reuses code from the legendary Alacritty for its ANSI parser, events, and grid system, plus borrows a few features, like a toggleable Vi mode.

Consider this post a little apropos of nothing given that nothing has actually been formally announced yet, but it seems that long-rumoured merger of Google’s two operating systems is indeed happening.

Sameer Samat, who works at Google as president of the Android Ecosystem division that oversees Android, casually mentioned the merger in an interview with TechRadar, saying:

“…we’re going to be combining ChromeOS and Android into a single platform, and I am very interested in how people are using their laptops these days and what they’re getting done.”

OMG! being read on Chrome OS in 2011

Combining operating systems would mean the end of one, since they are fundamentally different. It’d clearly be Chrome OS; Android is the brand with marketshare and mindshare, and does most of what Chrome OS can (Android 16 added GPU-accelerated Linux VM and a terminal).

Rumours about Google rebasing Chrome OS on Android have been kicking around for years, stretching as far back as 2014 when Google created ARC as a way to run Android apps via Chrome as ‘extensions’ (something you didn’t need Chrome OS for).

So why is a merger only being confirmed now, over a decade later?

Samat references Apple, the recent gap closing between iPadOS and macOS workflow, and the power of the productivity synergy the Apple ecosystem boasts by virtue of running on All The Things™ – things Android could very easily run on too.

Yet, Google may be more motivated by antitrust actions.

Plasma Bigscreen is a shell designed for use on televisions and other large displays, using a remote for navigation rather than mouse or keyboard. It’s been around for a while (I wrote about it in 2022) but if I’m frank—I’m not, I’m Joey—I’d forgotten it existed.

KDE developer Espi, a regular contributor to Plasma Mobile, had not.

But he found the project in a state of limbo. Though ported to Plasma 6, Bigscreen had seen scant development in the years since and had been dropped from the main Plasma release cycle and from the package repos of most Linux distributions.

In a detailed blog post Espi says that upon seeing this dearth in development effort he “sensed an opportunity” to do something about it, and decided to “take a swing at improving the project” over the course of a week.

And its new programming makes for some must-see TV.

Plasma Bigscreen Sees a Big Refresh

Original image: Espi

Espi’s big Bigscreen revamp brings the home screen UI much closer to the original Breeze Ocean mockups, with a cleaner, flatter design, a dynamically expanding clock widget, and a KRunner-based search tools to make finding and launching apps faster.

The Settings interface was rejigged, now sporting a sidebar layout, using vertical scrolling stacks for toggles and content, and making use of a custom-made component library (which other contributors and developers can use) for building TV-focused UIs.

The newer, KODI-esque approach works well

Beyond what’s visible on screen are extensive changes under the hood, ranging from QML library updates and module fixes to greater use of tools and other Plasma components.

All of it is real, working code.

Espi tested the work on his television by compiling Bigscreen on postmarketOS and running it off "

While a lot of hype has been generated over features planned for Blender 5.0, the the Blender 4.5 change-log is by no means meek, offering a mix of performance, usability and tooling tweaks.

“With 2 years of updates, full Vulkan support, and quality-of-life improvements, Blender 4.5 LTS is every Blenderhead’s best friend,” the launch page states.

The promise of full Vulkan support ‘on par with OpenGL’ is the big draw in this release, gaining support for more features on Windows/Linux like OpenXR, Subdivision, and USD/Hydra. Limitations remain, and it is not enabled by default – flicking a switch in Preferences required.

If trying the Vulkan backend in Blender 4.5 on Linux, those with AMD GPUs are advised to use Mesa 25.3 (or newer)—FYI: Ubuntu 24.04 is getting Mesa 25.0.7 as a HWE update—and Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs need driver version 550 or higher.

Other changes and additions in Blender 4.5 LTS:

New Geometry Nodes focused on data access and string handling

New Grease Pencil nodes have been added

Denoise node now supports GPU devices

Procedural texture nodes now available in the Compositor

“Boundary Strokes” renamed “Fill Guides”

Option to only show onion skinning for the active object in Viewport

SVG exporter can now export animations

Multi-threaded shader compilation enabled by default

Liquid simulation performance improved by 1.25x – 1.5x

Playhead element snapping available in all timeline editors

Video Sequencer supports HDR

Faster texture loading in EEVEE

New shadow terminator bias

Support for writing ProRes codec videos

Samsung wants to know if Galaxy owners prefer Qi2 magnets over thin phones,"Samsung hasn’t fully adopted Qi2 in Galaxy smartphones yet, with the focus instead seemingly being on making phones thinner.

In a new survey, though, Samsung is directly asking users if they’d prefer proper Qi2 support over a thinner smartphone.

Through the Samsung Members app (as noted by SammryGuru), Samsung is currently running a survey of Galaxy owners which, among other things, directly asks about Qi2 support. The first question asks if having “Qi2 (like MagSafe)” would “reduce any inconvenience” if the device were to only support charging via wireless charging methods.

But in other questions, Samsung asks regarding if users want magnets built into their phone at the expense of the device being thinner. The question asks:

Would you prefer to have magnets built into the phone even if it made the phone thicker? If the phone becomes thicker, I prefer not to have magnets

Prefer adding magnets even if it makes the phone thicker (within 0.3mm)

Prefer adding magnets even if it makes the phone thicker (within 0.5mm)

Magnets must be included regardless of the increase in thickness

As it stands today, Samsung has opted to offload the magnets to one of its official cases, as well as relying on third-party brands to add the functionality. The Galaxy S25 series and the company’s new foldables are “Qi 2.1.0” certified, but they leverage “Qi2 Ready” to skip having the magnets inside of the phones themselves.

It’s good to know that the company is at least considering the idea of having magnets built in, but this survey is still a long ways away from actually implementing this change.

Once available, Chrome will show a “You can touch and hold to move the address bar to the bottom.” This opens a new menu to let you “Move address bar to the bottom,” while there’s now a convenient “Copy link” option. There’s also a new “Address bar” page at the top of the Chrome > Settings menu.

This moves the Omnibox above the gesture navigation bar for improved one-handed usage. The three-dot overflow menu is moved slightly down, but there’s no change to the order. It maintains muscle memory, but rearranging might have helped centralize common controls at the bottom. One upside, however, is how Share is pretty reachable.

A bottom address bar for Chrome on Android has been a long-time coming. It was considered around 2016 and almost launched before Google canceled the effort. Afterwards, the company tried various other designs like keeping the address bar at the top but having a toolbar at the bottom (like Safari on iOS). Ultimately, Google maintained the original look that has been around for ages with some visual modernizations over the years.

In a new interview, we’re getting some insight into the sacrifices made to achieve these new designs, and whether the S Pen could make a comeback in the future.

Samsung MX Managing Director Kang Min-seok sat down with Korea’s ET News to discuss everything that went into crafting the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7, including some of the more controversial choices behind both products. To its credit, Samsung isn’t shying away from the controversy around the Fold 7’s missing S Pen support. While some people find the missing digitizer, the removed under-display camera, and the lack of improvements to battery or charging to be complete non-starter, Kang says those sacrifices were made on purpose.

“The Fold 7 emphasized that consumers want a ‘thin and light product,’” Kang told ET News in a machine-translated interview. “Please think of it as a ‘trade-off’ where you lose one if you choose one.”

Kang confirmed that any removed or static features were made to chase that ultra-slim 8.9mm chassis, though he did stress that the company is “pursuing a perfect product balance, not just thinness and lightness.” That drive should bleed into future generations of the Fold series, as Kang specifically notes Samsung is “researching and developing thinner and innovative technologies for the S Pen” in order to “reconsider it when the level of perfection increases and there is consumer demand.”

Likewise, despite its larger 8-inch footprint, the foldable display is 39% thinner and, once again, 43% lighter than its preceding model, all while adding titanium to the bottom of the device allowed fo"

In a press release, OnePlus has announced that its “Plus Mind” feature is coming to the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R “over the coming weeks.”

“Plus Mind” first launched on the OnePlus 13T/13s earlier this year as an option to use content on screen to gather information, save content for later, or generate AI-powered action items. For example, Plus Mind can automatically recognize details from a poster and create an event. Where the OnePlus 13T and OnePlus 13s use this through the dedicated “Plus Key” (which replaces the Alert Slider), the OnePlus 13 and 13R will use a three-finger swipe upwards on the display.

OnePlus says this feature will arrive “over the coming weeks” in the US and Canada, and they’re also coming to other regions too.

One standout addition enables you to create new reminders faster than ever, here’s how it works.

‘New Reminder’ control in iOS 26 enables fast task creation without opening the app

I’ve tried many task managers over the years, and while they all have their strengths and weaknesses, one of the most important details to me is task input.

Creating new tasks should be quick and easy, and if it’s not, I’ll likely find a new app.

Apple’s Reminders app has gotten better on this front in the last several years. But there’s a change coming in iOS 26 that makes creating reminders even faster than ever.

Reminders now offers a ‘New Reminder’ control that can be added to several places:

Action button

Lock Screen

Control Center

This ‘New Reminder’ control provides a popup panel where you can quickly type out a new task, including adding due dates, flags, and more.

The appeal is simple: by assigning the new control to convenient locations, you can quickly create tasks without opening the full Reminders app.

Some users may add the control to Control Center or their Lock Screen, but I’ve found it especially useful when assigned to the iPhone’s Action button.

Reminders’ iOS 26 addition is perfect for the Action button

When the Action button is set to trigger ‘New Reminder,’ you can easily jot down a reminder at any time in mere seconds.

Whether you’re on your Lock Screen, Home Screen, or actively using another app, the Action button is the quickest way to create a new reminder.

The popup panel supports natural language input for due dates, and includes quick access to important fields like:

Assigned List

Notes

Date

Location

Flag

If you’ve been unsure what to use your iPhone’s Action button for—perhaps especially now that there’s a dedicated Camera Control button too—the ‘New Reminder’ control is a great option.

But this morning at Amazon we spotted the 24GB 15-inch model with as much as $180 in savings to undercut the best deals we spotted last week for Prime Day and you can get all of the details below.

So as of right now, most configurations are still $150 off the list prices from Apple. While some have jumped up slightly we are still seeing 13-inch models starting from $849 and most options with at least $150 in savings.

However, folks interested in the upgraded 15-inch variant with the 24GB RAM count and the 512GB internal SSD will find that Amazon has dropped the Starlight model down to $1,419 shipped from the regular $1,599 list price. This is a straight up $180 in savings and the best cash deal we have tracked for the big summer savings season.

Even though launch timing for the new AirPods is still uncertain, rumors around features have been a little more solid, including a new feature that’s expected to be borrowed directly from Beats: heart rate monitoring.

Heart rate monitoring coming to AirPods Pro 3, following Powerbeats Pro 2

Apple has long offered AirPods integration with health-related software features. For example, the iPhone’s Health app can show you data for Headphone Audio Levels to ensure your noise exposure stays moderate.

Last fall, the AirPods health story got even more compelling with three major new features:

Hearing Test

Hearing Aid

Hearing Protection

These additions were exclusive to AirPods Pro 2, but still relied on existing hardware that’s been around for years.

With AirPods Pro 3 though, Apple is set to introduce brand new sensors into the hardware to power a new feature: heart rate monitoring.

Mark Gurman at Bloomberg has reported that Apple has various health projects in the works for AirPods. But adding a heart rate monitor to AirPods Pro 3 is reportedly the top priority.

Powerbeats Pro 2, interestingly, launched earlier this year with a built-in heart rate monitor as a tentpole feature.

As a result, if AirPods Pro 3 do end up including this new feature, they will be following in the footsteps of a product from the Apple-owned Beats.

It’s curious that a flagship new feature would debut on Beats before AirPods, but that sounds like exactly what’s going to happen.

Perhaps Powerbeats got priority because heart rate monitoring is a core Apple Watch feature today, and many Beats customers aren’t part of the Apple ecosystem—unlike AirPods users.

It’s also possible that Apple plans to offer improved heart rate data when you combine the sensors from both AirPods and Apple Watch. We’ll have to wait until AirPods Pro 3’s arrival to find out.

The company says the changes are to ""meet the evolving needs of neighbors everywhere"" as the shift toward remote and hybrid work has resulted in people spending more time in their local communities.

The redesign focuses on three core features that will help you navigate the goings-on of your neighborhood: Alerts, News and Faves. Here's how each of these features works, and how the service is incorporating an artificial intelligence chatbot into the app's overhaul.

The Nextdoor Alerts feature combines information from trusted sources, local emergency services and your neighbors to give you the fullest understanding of a situation. Nextdoor/Screenshot by Tyler Lacoma/CNET

Alerts

As a local social media application, Nextdoor has been able to share information about local emergencies or crises in the past. Identifying this important use case, developers created the Alert tab, a map expressly designed to help you stay on top of critical happenings nearby.

The map tracks power outages, severe weather, wildfires and more. Nextdoor powers this new feature through partnerships with providers like Samdesk and The Weather Company, integrating their latest updates into the map.

The Alerts tab will also allow you to converse with your neighbors about what's happening nearby, sharing warnings or the latest information about a crisis. Local public agencies (such as your town's fire department) can also send out news blasts directly to the Nextdoor Alerts tab.

Ofcom, the UK regulator, said: ""We expect other companies to follow suit, or face enforcement if they fail to act.""

Reddit, known for its online communities and discussions, said that while it does not want to know who its audience is: ""It would be helpful for our safety efforts to be able to confirm whether you are a child or an adult.""

The social media platform brought in the measures to comply with new rules under the UK's Online Safety Act which require sites that show adult material to introduce ""robust"" age checking techniques.

Reddit has introduced age verification on its UK site to stop people aged under 18 from looking at ""certain mature content"".

Reddit said that from 14 July, an outside firm called Persona will perform age verification for the social media platform either through an uploaded selfie or ""a photo of your government ID"", such as a passport.

It said Reddit will not have access to the photo and will only retain a user's verification status and date of birth so people do not have to re-enter it each time they try to access restricted content.

The setup for the age verification app is built on the same technical specifications as the European Digital Identity Wallet which will be rolled out next year. The five countries can customise the model according to their requirements, integrate into a national app or keep it separately.

The EU executive also published guidelines for online platforms to take measures to protect minors as part of their compliance with the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA).

The landmark legislation, which became applicable last year, requires Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance's TikTok and other online companies to do more to tackle illegal and harmful online content.

Elon Musk's X, TikTok, Meta's Facebook and Instagram and several adult content websites are currently being investigated by EU regulators on whether they comply with the DSA.

EU regulators said the new guidelines would help online platforms to tackle addictive design, cyberbullying, harmful content and unwanted contact from strangers.

""Platforms have no excuse to be continuing practices that put children at risk,"" EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.

The effect of social media on children's mental health has become a growing global concern, with dozens of U.S. states suing Meta, while Australia last year banned social media for children under 16."

Months after construction began in 2018, the Morrises’ dishwasher, ice maker, washing machine and toilet all stopped working, said Beverly Morris, now 71. Within a year, the water pressure had slowed to a trickle. Soon, nothing came out of the bathroom and kitchen taps.

Jeff Morris, 67, eventually traced the issues to the buildup of sediment in the water. He said he suspected the cause was Meta’s construction, which could have added sediment to the groundwater and affected their well.

Newcastle bid for Ekitike; Liverpool want Isak,Newcastle are exploring a move for Hugo Ekitike - but would the French striker play with Alexander Isak or replace him?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g80nryyyro,BBC Sport,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/620a/live/845ef980-619a-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.jpg,Sports,"It is not often supporters are worried by rumours their club might be about to break their transfer record.

But that is what is happening among some Newcastle United fans, with the Magpies moving for Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike.

Newcastle's initial bid of £70m has been turned down by the Bundesliga club as the Magpies seek to agree what would be a club-record deal to land the coveted young forward.

With Premier League champions Liverpool also in the market for a central striker and known to have firm interest in Newcastle's Alexander Isak, it is inevitable some are drawing a certain conclusion.

BBC Sport understands the Premier League champions have made a move towards a deal for the Sweden striker in recent days. They have also explored the parameters for other centre-forward targets.

According to sources, it is believed a package to sign Isak could cost up to £130m - and the Magpies have been steadfast in their stance that their superstar striker is not for sale.

Those who know Newcastle believe they are trying to build a multi-layered attack capable of quickly switching tactics.

Those who know Ekitike, who has also been linked with Liverpool, know him as a versatile forward capable of scoring from all sorts of positions.

Newcastle have maintained throughout the summer that their top players - and Isak is certainly one of those - are not available for transfer.

So would Ekitike be a partner for Isak - or is there is a danger he could be his replacement?"
West Indies all out for 27 - the numbers behind extraordinary collapse,BBC Sport looks at the numbers behind West Indies' second-lowest Test score of 27.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c70r7dk01w0o,BBC Sport,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/24f3/live/87a93160-616c-11f0-9f1b-2f590c922666.jpg,Sports,"Like any Test match there were a number of factors at play.

The pitch certainly favoured the bowlers, with Australia's first innings 225 the highest total of the match before the tourists were bowled out for just 121 in their second innings.

Then there is the quality of the opposition. Australia are the number one ranked Test team in the world while West Indies are eighth out of 12.

The tourists, who host England in the Ashes this winter, won their matches in the three-Test series by 159, 133 and 176 runs respectively.

Mitchell Starc, one of the best fast bowlers of this generation, bowled a fearsome opening spell that demolished the West Indies' top order in Jamaica on Monday.

""Out of nowhere,"" said Australia captain Pat Cummins, Starc can ""tear an opposition apart and win a game for you.""

Left-armer Starc was also armed with a pink ball since the third Test was a day-night game. Starc has taken 81 wickets in day-night cricket, far ahead of the next best, his Australia team-mate Cummins who has 43.

The pink ball has similar characteristics to one-day cricket's white ball in that some believe it swings more, certainly in the right conditions. Of bowlers to have taken more than 200 wickets in one-day internationals, only India's Mohammed Shami (25.8) has a better strike-rate (wickets taken per 100 balls) than Starc's frankly incredible 26.6.

Australia were also helped by some pretty sloppy shots as the batting line-up disintegrated. Of those who played, opener John Campbell was the highest-ranked player in the world Test batting rankings at 78. Australia have four in the current top 20: Steve Smith, Travis Head, Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja.

""Assessing this series is simple: the bowlers kept us in the contest and the batting let us down time after time,"" was captain Roston Chase's frank assessment.

It is further evidence of the decline of West Indies cricket since its 1970s and 1980s heyday.

Of the 87 Test series they have played since 2000, West Indies ha"

The 43-year-old Spaniard replaces Ruud van Nistelrooy at the Foxes' helm with less than a month until the season starts.

Cifuentes takes charge of a Leicester side that finds itself in the Championship for the second time in three years, having been immediately relegated from the Premier League after going up as second-tier title winners under Enzo Maresca in 2024.

Cifuentes now joins Maresca, who left Leicester after promotion to take the job at Chelsea, as one of the six permanent managers the Foxes have had in just over two years.

Just as the Italian was tasked with returning the East Midlands club to the top flight during his tenure, promotion will also be expected of Cifuentes.

In his time at QPR, the Spaniard, for whom the Foxes will pay Rangers an undisclosed compensation fee, oversaw 18th and 15th-placed finishes.

Leicester say they feel the Spaniard will bring ""a modern, progressive footballing philosophy"" to the club, while chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha says that Cifuentes ""is an excellent fit"".

""We felt strongly that bringing him to the club would help us to create the success we all want in the years ahead,"" Srivaddhanaprabha added.

Cifuentes took charge of QPR when they were second-from-bottom in the Championship in October 2023 and escaping relegation was first asked of him at Loftus Road.

His latest campaign ended with him on gardening leave after the Hoops suffered a 5-0 defeat by already-promoted Burnley in April."

Nvidia Says U.S. Has Lifted Restrictions on A.I. Chip Sales to China,"The Silicon Valley chip giant said the Trump administration, which had shut down its sales to China three months ago, had assured it that licenses for the sales would now be granted.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/nvidia-ai-chip-sales-china.html,NY Times Tech,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/14/multimedia/14biz-nvidia-bgpm/14biz-nvidia-bgpm-mediumSquareAt3X.jpg,World,"Three months after shutting down Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chip sales to China, the Trump administration has reversed course.

On Monday, the Silicon Valley company said in a blog post that the U.S. government had approved sales of a China-specific A.I. chip known as the H20. Nvidia will still need licensing approval from the U.S. government to fulfill those orders, but the Trump administration “has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted,” the company said.

The decision came after Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, met last Thursday with President Trump. Mr. Huang has spent months lobbying politicians across Washington to keep China open for A.I. chip sales. China has the potential to deliver billions of dollars in sales for the world’s most valuable public company, which last week became the first to reach a $4 trillion valuation.

Mr. Huang has also visited China several times this year, including a trip to Beijing this week where he is scheduled to give a news conference on Wednesday. He told reporters in China on Tuesday that Nvidia would also begin selling a chip for China called the RTX PRO GPU that is based on its latest Blackwell technology."

The company, which has made most of its money from online advertising, generated more than $160bn in revenue in 2024.

Meta has invested heavily in efforts to develop what it called ""superintelligence"" - technology that it said could out-think the smartest humans.

He said one of the sites would cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan (59.1 sq km/22.8 sq miles).

The first multi-gigawatt data centre, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, Zuckerberg said.

Meta's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said the social media giant will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building huge AI data centres in the US.

In a post on his social media platform, Threads, Zuckerberg said Meta was building several multi-gigawatt clusters, and that one cluster, called Hyperion, could scale up to five gigawatts over several years.

""We're building multiple more titan clusters as well. Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,"" he added.

Prometheus will be built in New Albany, Ohio, while Hyperion will be built in Louisiana and is expected to be fully online by 2030, Zuckerberg said.

He said Meta would ""invest hundreds of billions of dollars... to build superintelligence"" and that the centres had been given ""names befitting their scale and impact"".

Karl Freund, principal analyst at Cambrian AI Research, told the BBC, ""clearly, Zuckerberg intends to spend his way to the top of the AI heap"".

""The talent he is hiring will have access to some of the best AI Hardware in the world,"" Freund added.

Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang is currently in China

The chips have been a key focus of export controls aimed at keeping the cutting-edge technology out of Beijing's hands as the AI race between the US and China heats up.

The move reverses a ban on sales of Nvidia's H20 chips to Beijing, which was imposed by US President Donald Trump's administration in April over concerns that they could be used by the Chinese military.

The US government has assured the firm that it will grant the licenses needed to restart exports to the world's second largest economy, the company said in a blog post .

US technology giant Nvidia says it will soon resume sales of its high-end artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China.

The US Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.

The H20 chip was developed specifically for the Chinese market after US export restrictions were imposed by the Biden administration in 2023. Its sale was effectively banned by the Trump administration in April this year.

The announcement came as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have been easing.

In May, the two governments agreed a temporary truce in their tariffs war.

They set a 12 August deadline to reach a longer term deal over the high tariffs imposed on each other since Trump returned to the White House this year.

In recent weeks, Beijing has relaxed trade controls on rare earth exports, while the US has lifted restrictions on chip design software firms operating in China.

Nvidia has long viewed China as a crucial market, with the country ranking among its top buyers globally.

Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang has spent months lobbying both sides for a resumption of sales of H20 chips in China.

The company said that Mr Huang, who is currently in China, met Trump to reaffirm Nvidia's commitment to create jobs and ensure the US leads in AI worldwide.

New AI voice tool trained to copy British regional accents,A UK company says it is better at reproducing a range of accents compared with US or Chinese rivals.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07d2dyx19zo,BBC Technology,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/bbb3/live/3843da00-60c5-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg,World,"New AI voice tool trained to copy British regional accents

A new AI voice-cloning tool from a British firm claims to be able to reproduce a range of UK accents more accurately than some of its US and Chinese rivals.

Because much of the data traditionally used to train AI products with voices comes from North American or southern English speaking sources, many artificial voices tend to sound similar.

To combat this, the company Synthesia spent a year compiling its own database of UK voices with regional accents, through recording people in studios and gathering online material.

It used those to train a product called Express-Voice, which can clone a real person's voice or generate a synthetic voice.

These can be used in content such as training videos, sales support and presentations.

The company said its customers wanted more accurate regional representations.

""If you're the CEO of a company, or if you're just a regular person, when you have your likeness, you want your accent to be preserved,"" said Synthesia Head of Research Youssef Alami Mejjati.

He added French-speaking customers had also commented that synthetic French voices tended to sound French-Canadian rather than originating from France.

""This is just because the companies building these models tend to be North American companies, and they tend to have datasets that are biased towards the demographics that they're in,"" he said.

The hardest accents to mimic are the least common, Mr Mejjati said, because there is less recorded material available to train an AI model.

There are also reports that voice-prompted AI products, such as smart speakers, are more likely to struggle to understand a range of accents.

Last year, internal documents from West Midlands Police revealed worries about whether voice recognition systems would understand Brummie accents.

Meanwhile the US-based start-up Sanas is taking the opposite approach, developing tools for deployment in call centres which ""neutralise"" the accen"

A WeTransfer spokeswoman told BBC News: ""We don't use machine learning or any form of AI to process content shared via WeTransfer, nor do we sell content or data to any third parties.""

The file sharing company had received lots of criticism from customers on social media after changing its terms of service, which some interpreted as allowing it the right to use files for AI training.

WeTransfer has confirmed it does not use files uploaded to their service to train artificial intelligence (AI) models.

WeTransfer said the clause was initially added to ""include the possibility of using AI to improve content moderation"" and to identify harmful content.

The terms had said WeTransfer could use content for purposes ""including to improve performance of machine learning models that enhance our content moderation process"".

It also included the right for WeTransfer to ""reproduce, distribute, modify,"" or ""publicly display"" files uploaded to the service.

Some users on social media interpreted this as WeTransfer giving itself the right to share or sell the files uploaded by users to AI companies.

People working in the creative industries, including an illustrator and an actor, posted on X to say they used the service to send work and were considering changing to alternative providers.

WeTransfer said it updated the clause on Tuesday, ""as we've seen this passage may have caused confusion for our customers.""

Last week, a small group of top members of the lab, including Alexandr Wang, 28, Meta’s new chief A.I. officer, discussed abandoning the company’s most powerful open source A.I. model, called Behemoth, in favor of developing a closed model, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

For years, Meta has chosen to open source its A.I. models, which means it makes the computer code public for other developers to build on. Closed models keep their underlying code private. Meta executives have long argued it is better for the technology to be built in public so that A.I. development will move faster and be accessible to more developers.

Any move toward a closed A.I. model would be a philosophical change at Meta as much as a technical one. Meta has won plaudits from developers for open sourcing its A.I. models, and one of its top A.I. executives, Yann LeCun, had said, “The platform that will win will be the open one.” This year, the Chinese A.I. company DeepSeek released an advanced A.I. chatbot thanks in part to Meta’s open source code."

The contracts will enable the DoD to develop agentic AI workflows and use them to address critical national security challenges, the department's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office said.

""The adoption of AI is transforming the (DoD's) ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,"" Chief Digital and AI Officer Doug Matty said.

U.S. government agencies have been expanding their use of AI, driven by a White House order in April promoting adoption. President Donald Trump has also moved to soften regulation on the technology by revoking a 2023 Biden-era executive order, which sought to reduce AI risks through mandatory data disclosures.

Separately on Monday, xAI announced a suite of its products called ""Grok for Government"", making its advanced AI models — including its latest flagship Grok 4 — available to federal, local, state and national security customers.

The Pentagon announced last month that OpenAI was awarded a $200 million contract, saying the ChatGPT maker would ""develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains"".

The contracts announced on Monday deepen the ties between companies leading the AI race and U.S. government operations, while addressing concerns around the need for competitive contracts for AI use in federal agencies.

In May, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren had urged DoD to ensure competitive AI contracting at a time when Musk's Grok chatbot was gaining ground in the federal government."

Amputees Say Advanced Bionic Leg Feels More Like a Part of Their Body,"Directly connected to bone, the leg allows wearers to climb stairs, walk at a normal speed, and kick balls.

It’s now possible to engineer light-weight custom lower legs with flexible ankles that fit onto a residual limb, commonly known as the stump. These prostheses allow people with lower-limb amputations to walk again. But they tend to fall more often and struggle to climb stairs, walk on uneven surfaces, or simply get out of a chair. The limbs also feel like attachments, rather than natural extensions of the body.

These problems are worse for people with above-knee amputations. Our knees support our body weight but can also bend and twist when jumping, twirling, hopping, or running.

This month, Herr and his team at MIT introduced a “bionic” leg capable of complex movements. The system is attached to the user’s leg bone for stability and records electrical activity from nearby muscles to translate intent into smooth movement.

Compared to people with traditional above-the-knee prostheses, those fitted with the bionic knee were far more agile. The two volunteers could easily stand up from a sitting position, step over stacked blocks, and kick a ball with minimal upper body support.

More importantly, both said the bionic leg felt like part of their body.

“A prosthesis that's tissue-integrated—anchored to the bone and directly controlled by the nervous system—is not merely a lifeless, separate device, but rather a system that is carefully integrated into human physiology, offering a greater level of prosthetic embodiment,” said Herr in a press release. “It’s not simply a tool that the human employs, but rather an integral part of self.”

Multiple Upgrades

This AI Gives You Power Over Your Data,"With FlexOlmo, people can train AI without handing over their data. They can even remove their contribution after the model is complete.
The post This AI Gives You Power Over Your Data appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/11/this-ai-gives-you-power-over-your-data/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/hand-in-front-of-light.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"Data is the lifeblood of modern AI, but people are increasingly wary of sharing their information with model builders. A new architecture could get around the problem by letting data owners control how training data is used even after a model has been built.

The impressive capabilities of today’s leading AI models are the result of an enormous data-scraping operation that hoovered up vast amounts of publicly available information. This has raised thorny questions around consent and whether people have been properly compensated for the use of their data. And data owners are increasingly looking for ways to protect their data from AI companies.

A new architecture from researchers at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) called FlexOlmo could present a potential workaround. FlexOlmo allows models to be trained on private datasets without owners ever having to share the raw data. It also lets owners remove their data, or limit its use, after training has finished.

“FlexOlmo opens the door to a new paradigm of collaborative AI development,” the Ai2 researchers wrote in a blog post describing the new approach. “Data owners who want to contribute to the open, shared language model ecosystem but are hesitant to share raw data or commit permanently can now participate on their own terms.”

The team developed the new architecture to solve several problems with the existing approach to model training. Currently, data owners must make a one-time and essentially irreversible decision about whether or not to include their information in a training dataset. Once this data has been publicly shared there’s little prospect of controlling who uses it. And if a model is trained on certain data there’s no way to remove it later on, short of completely retraining the model. Given the cost of cutting-edge training runs, few model developers are likely to agree to this.

FlexOlmo gets around this by allowing each data owner to train a separate model on their own data. These models are then m"
A New Device Pulls Water From Thin Air—Even in Death Valley,"Portable, reusable, and affordable, the device is the latest in technologies aiming to expand access to drinking water.
The post A New Device Pulls Water From Thin Air—Even in Death Valley appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/10/this-device-pulls-water-from-thin-air-even-in-death-valley/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/MIT-Water-Harvester-01-press_0.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"It’s easy to take safe drinking water for granted. In most developed countries, access to safe water takes a simple flip of a kitchen tap or a run to the grocery store.

But over two billion people worldwide lack easy access to clean water, which can lead to diseases such as cholera. And the problem is getting worse as demand for water in farming and other industries increases.

One blue-sky solution may literally come from the sky. A team from MIT developed a window-sized portable device that pulls water vapor from the atmosphere. The sandwich-like contraption includes an origami-like hydrogel to capture moisture at night. As day breaks, it releases water vapor onto glass panels where the vapor condenses into drinking water.

The device, dubbed atmospheric water harvesting window, or AWHW, generated a modest amount of water in different environments—including a humid urban setting in Massachusetts and the desert of Death Valley.

It’s performance is “remarkable,” wrote Jiabin Liu and Shaoting Lin at Michigan State University, who were not involved in the work.

Liker solar panels, the device could produce more water if it was bigger or multiple were stacked into vertical “water farms.” For now, its portability could potentially aid thirsty hikers or soldiers trekking through hot terrain.

“We imagine that you could one day deploy an array of these panels, and the footprint is very small because they are all vertical,” said study author Xuanhe Zhao in a press release.

Compared to bottled water, the device is highly cost-effective. “The economic advantage makes it a potentially off-grid solution for communities facing persistent water scarcity,” wrote Liu and Lin. The device “offers a practical and deployable solution for providing affordable family-scale drinking water.”

Nothing Headphone 1 Review: Absolutely worth a look,"Nothing design team has created a device that looks unapologetically different. The Nothing Headphone 1 is the company’s first foray into the over-the-ear category, and it is eye-catching without being too flashy",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/nothing-headphone-1-review-absolutely-worth-a-look/article69813840.ece,The Hindu - Technology,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/b49rmz/article69813863.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_3437.JPG,India,"To start with, I must say full marks go to the Nothing design team for once again creating a device that looks unapologetically different. The Nothing Headphone 1 is the company’s first foray into the over-the-ear category. The headphones are eye-catching without being too flashy. With its see-through plastic panels and sculpted aluminium framing, it manages to be both a callback to old-school tech and a bold vision of the future. But beyond the head-turning design, the question remains: does it deliver enough performance and justify its ₹21,999 price tag to go toe-to-toe with heavyweights like Sony, Sennheiser and Apple? To get the full answer, let’s dive into the details.

Design

First impression? These headphones look like they dropped out of a futuristic arcade. The transparent casing reveals non-functional, but visually intriguing internals, framed by precision-cut aluminium. It’s all very “Nothing” — in the best way. The aesthetic lands somewhere between a Nintendo Walkman hybrid and something you’d expect to see on the set of Blade Runner.

What’s more, the headphones feel substantial without being heavy. Weighing in at 329g, the Headphone 1 is heavier than some competitors but wears its weight well. The adjustable telescopic arms, memory foam earcups, and a generously cushioned headband create a comfortable seal that holds up through long editing sessions and travel days alike. The earcups rotate flat but don’t fold, which affects portability, though the included softshell case, with its thumb-indented design and cable pouch, helps. One small gripe: the corners of the square-shaped earcups can bump against each other when hung around the neck, potentially causing cosmetic wear.

That said, durability has been clearly prioritised. The Headphone 1 has passed over 50 reliability tests, including drops, twists, sweat exposure, and extreme temperatures. And here’s something rare for premium over-ear headphones — an IP52 rating. That means these cans are resistan"
"AI Might Now Be as Good as Humans at Detecting Emotion, Political Leaning, and Sarcasm","Maybe machines aren't so hopeless at detecting nuance after all.
The post AI Might Now Be as Good as Humans at Detecting Emotion, Political Leaning, and Sarcasm appeared first on SingularityHub.",https://singularityhub.com/2025/07/15/ai-might-now-be-as-good-as-humans-at-detecting-emotion-political-leaning-and-sarcasm/,SingularityHub,https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/07/persons-hand-texting-smartphone.jpeg?auto=webp,World,"When we write something to another person, over email or perhaps on social media, we may not state things directly, but our words may instead convey a latent meaning—an underlying subtext. We also often hope that this meaning will come through to the reader.

But what happens if an artificial intelligence system is at the other end, rather than a person? Can AI, especially conversational AI, understand the latent meaning in our text? And if so, what does this mean for us?

Latent content analysis is an area of study concerned with uncovering the deeper meanings, sentiments, and subtleties embedded in text. For example, this type of analysis can help us grasp political leanings present in communications that are perhaps not obvious to everyone.

Understanding how intense someone’s emotions are or whether they’re being sarcastic can be crucial in supporting a person’s mental health, improving customer service, and even keeping people safe at a national level.

These are only some examples. We can imagine benefits in other areas of life, like social science research, policymaking, and business. Given how important these tasks are—and how quickly conversational AI is improving—it’s essential to explore what these technologies can (and can’t) do in this regard.

Work on this issue is only just starting. Current work shows that ChatGPT has had limited success in detecting political leanings on news websites. Another study that focused on differences in sarcasm detection between different large language models—the technology behind AI chatbots such as ChatGPT—showed that some are better than others.

Finally, a study showed that LLMs can guess the emotional “valence” of words—the inherent positive or negative feeling associated with them. Our new study published in Scientific Reports tested whether conversational AI, inclusive of GPT-4—a relatively recent version of ChatGPT—can read between the lines of human-written texts.

The goal was to find out how well LLMs simulate "
"LinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes",LinkedIn has agreed to make temporary changes to its contracting practices to settle a lawsuit by U.S. users who claimed it schemed to prevent potential rivals from entering the market,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/linkedin-settles-antitrust-lawsuit-agrees-to-contracting-changes/article69813357.ece,The Hindu - Technology,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/biwlp0/article69813358.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-06-04T150246Z_1153076761_RC2UFZ99JRX0_RTRMADP_3_MICROSOFT-REORG.JPG,India,"Business social network LinkedIn has agreed to make temporary changes to its contracting practices to settle a lawsuit by U.S. users who claimed it schemed to prevent potential rivals from entering the market.

The preliminary class action settlement, which does not include a financial payment, was filed on Friday in the federal court in San Francisco and requires a judge’s approval.

LinkedIn was accused in the 2022 lawsuit of illegally fashioning some business contracts to bar third-parties from competing with the company, allowing it to overcharge for premium services and upgraded account features.

The plaintiffs said LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft , was “effectively paying potential competitors not to enter the market.”

LinkedIn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft was not a defendant. LinkedIn denied any wrongdoing.

The plaintiffs' lawyers declined to comment.

Under the terms of the deal, LinkedIn said for three years it will not enforce provisions in current or future contracts for ""application programming interfaces"" that would restrict a third-party potential rival from competing.

The contracts at issue in the lawsuit allowed LinkedIn business partners to access private user data ""in exchange for restraints against competing with LinkedIn,"" according to the settlement filing.

The plaintiffs said the pause would allow potential rivals to compete more effectively, facilitate reduced prices and increase consumer choice.

There are about 9 million people in the settlement class, which includes LinkedIn members who purchased LinkedIn Premium services between January 13, 2018, and the present, according to the settlement.

Members of the class can opt out of the settlement to sue individually for alleged damages, the settlement said.

The plaintiffs said they planned to present expert testimony at the time of final approval to show the overall value of the settlement, since there is no money being paid to LinkedIn users.

Finding value with AI automation,"In June 2023, technology leaders and IT services executives had a lightning bolt headed their way when McKinsey published the “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier” report. It echoed a moment from the 2010s when Amazon Web Services launched an advertising campaign ",https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/15/1119978/finding-value-with-ai-automation/,MIT Technology Review,,World,"Today's opportunity: Significant automation gains

When leaders respond to immediate panic, new business risks and mitigations often emerge. Two recent examples highlight the consequences of rushing to implement and publish positive results from AI adoption. The Wall Street Journal reported in April 2025 on companies struggling to realize returns on AI. Just weeks later, it covered MIT’s retraction of a technical paper about AI where the results that led to its publication could not be substantiated.

While these reports demonstrate the pitfalls of over-reliance on AI without common-sense guardrails, not all is off track in the land of enterprise AI adoption. Incredible results being found from judicious use of AI and related technologies in automating processes across industries. Now that we are through the “fear of missing out” stage and can get down to business, where are the best places to look for value when applying AI to automation of your business?

While chatbots are almost as pervasive as new app downloads for mobile phones, the applications of AI realizing automation and productivity gains line up with the unique purpose and architecture of the underlying AI system they are built on. The dominant patterns where AI gains are realized currently boil down to two things: language (translation and patterns) and data (new format creation and data search).

Example one: Natural language processing

Manufacturing automation challenge: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is both critical and often labor intensive. It is not always performed prior to a failure in manufacturing equipment, so very often FMEA occurs in a stressful manufacturing lines-down scenario. In Intel’s case, a global footprint of manufacturing facilities separated by large distances along with time zones and preferred language differences makes this even more difficult to find the root cause of a problem. Weeks of engineering effort are spent per FMEA analysis repeated across large fleets "

Shaping the future with adaptive production,"Adaptive production is more than a technological upgrade: it is a paradigm shift. This new frontier enables the integration of cutting-edge technologies to create an increasingly autonomous environment, where interconnected manufacturing plants go beyond the limits of traditional automation. Artific",https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/15/1120083/shaping-the-future-with-adaptive-production/,MIT Technology Review,,World,"As efforts to revive and modernize local manufacturing accelerate in regions around the world, including North America and Europe, adaptive production could help manufacturers overcome some of their biggest obstacles—firstly, attracting and retaining talent. Nearly 60% of manufacturers cited this as their top challenge in a 2024 US-based survey. Highly automated, technology-led adaptive production methods hold new promise for attracting talent to roles that are safer, less repetitive, and better paid. “The ideal scenario is one where AI enhances human capabilities, leads to new task creation, and empowers the people who are most at risk from automation’s impact on certain jobs, particularly those without college degrees,” says Simon Johnson, co-director of MIT’s Shaping the Future of Work Initiative.

Secondly, the digitalization of manufacturing—embedded in the very foundation of adaptive production technologies—allows companies to better address complex sustainability challenges through process and resource optimization and a better understanding of data. “By integrating these advanced technologies, we gain a more comprehensive picture across the entire production process and product lifecycle,” explains Jelena Mitic, head of technology for the Future of Automation at Siemens. “This will provide a much faster and more efficient way to optimize operations and ensure that all the necessary safety and sustainability requirements are met during quality control.”

Google’s generative video model Veo 3 has a subtitles problem,"As soon as Google launched its latest video-generating AI model at the end of May, creatives rushed to put it through its paces.

Users have been forced to resort to regenerating clips (which costs them more money), using external subtitle-removing tools, or cropping their videos to get rid of the subtitles altogether.

Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, posted on X on June 9 that Google had developed fixes to reduce the gibberish text. But over a month later, users are still logging issues with it in Google Labs’ Discord channel, demonstrating how difficult it can be to correct issues in major AI models.

Like its predecessors, Veo 3 is available to paying members of Google’s subscription tiers, which start at $249.99 a month. To generate an eight-second clip, users enter a text prompt describing the scene they’d like to create into Google’s AI filmmaking tool Flow, Gemini, or other Google platforms. Each Veo 3 generation costs a minimum of 20 AI credits, and the account can be topped up at a cost of $25 per 2,500 credits.

Mona Weiss, an advertising creative director, says that regenerating her scenes in a bid to get rid of the random captions is becoming expensive. “If you’re creating a scene with dialogue, up to 40% of its output has gibberish subtitles that make it unusable,” she says. “You’re burning through money trying to get a scene you like, but then you can’t even use it.”

When Weiss reported the problem to Google Labs through its Discord channel in the hopes of getting a refund for her wasted credits, its team pointed her to the company’s official support team. They offered her a refund for the cost of Veo 3, but not for the credits. Weiss declined, as accepting would have meant losing access to the model altogether. The Google Labs’ Discord support team has been telling users that subtitles can be triggered by speech, saying that they’re aware of the problem and are working to fix it."
Building community and clean air solutions,"When Darren Riley moved to Detroit seven years ago, he didn’t expect the city’s air to change his life—literally.

Thanks for having me.

Megan: Thank you ever so much for being with us. To get us started, let's just talk a bit about JustAir. How did the idea for the company come about, and what does your company do as well?

Darren: Yeah, absolutely. The real thesis of JustAir, is really a combination of one, my personal experience but also my professional experience. On the professional side, background in software engineering, graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, but I was always fascinated by how to use technology to really support and innovate and really push the frontier on issues that are near and dear to my heart. Coming from Houston, Texas, coming from communities that often are restricted with certain issues, systemic issues, is something that I always carried in my heart.

And on the personal side, it was around seven years ago when I moved to Detroit, in Southwest Detroit, where I developed asthma. Not growing up with asthma and not developing any issues, having that disease of the lungs really opened my eyes to just how much our environment impacts our health and well-being.



The combination of those, that pain point and also my background in technology, I was fascinated about why we don’t have the data we need or why we don’t have the infrastructure to solve these issues, to understand where pollution is coming from, how it’s impacting our communities, so that we can solve these problems and make an equitable breathing environment for everybody. That's kind of what birthed JustAir in a way.



And actually, it was around COVID-19 where we really started to push forward, where we saw all this information and research around health disparities and a lot of the issues of mortality rates around COVID-19, which kind of coincides with COPD, asthma, and other diseases that are often overburdened in communities that look like ours, in Black and brown communities. That's kind of where we got our start.

The move follows a $2.4 billion deal by Google to acquire some of Windsurf’s top executives and license the start-up’s technology, which was revealed on Friday. Google’s deal appeared to leave Windsurf in a difficult position as a stand-alone start-up. OpenAI, the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot, had also been in talks to buy Windsurf before the Google deal.

“We’ve long admired the Windsurf team and what they’ve built,” said Scott Wu, a co-founder of Cognition, in an email to employees viewed by The New York Times. “Within our lifetime, engineers will go from bricklayers to architects, focusing on the creativity of designing systems rather than the manual labor of putting them together.”

The price of the deal could not immediately be learned.

Cognition’s move comes amid a flurry of activity by Meta, Google and OpenAI, which are racing against one another to scoop up a small pool of top technology talent in an increasingly competitive space."

How it works: Currently, companies tend to deal with this issue by checking whether the prompts or the AI’s responses contain disallowed material. Machine unlearning instead asks whether an AI can be made to forget a piece of information that the company doesn’t want it to know. It works by taking a model and the specific data to be redacted then using them to create a new model—essentially, a version of the original that never learned that piece of data.

AI’s giants want to take over the classroom

School’s out and it’s high summer, but a bunch of teachers are plotting how they’re going to use AI this upcoming school year. God help them.

On July 8, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic announced a $23 million partnership with one of the largest teachers’ unions in the United States to bring more AI into K–12 classrooms. They will train teachers at a New York City headquarters on how to use AI both for teaching and for tasks like planning lessons and writing reports, starting this fall.



But these companies could face an uphill battle. There's a lack of clear evidence that AI can be a net benefit for students, and it's hard to trust that the AI companies funding this initiative will give honest advice on when not to use AI in the classroom. Read the full story."
Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now,"If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup.

Events like Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often ",https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals,The Verge,,Technology,"If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. Events like Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often bring the steepest discounts, though you can still find great deals throughout the year.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.

The best AirPods 4 deals

At its September event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.

The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.

The post How To Get Armadillo Scutes in Minecraft? appeared first on Fossbytes.",https://fossbytes.com/how-to-get-armadillo-scutes-in-minecraft/,Fossbytes,,Technology,"Armadillo Scutes are a new addition to Minecraft that help players make wolf armour. This can be extremely useful, as everyone wants to protect their loyal dogs. Here’s the easiest way you can get Armadillo Scutes in Minecraft.

How To Get Armadillo Scutes?

Armadillo scutes are a new handy addition to Minecraft, especially if you want to make wolf armor. These are acquired from the armadillo mob. Armadillos can roam around hot biomes, such as savannas and badlands, but are somewhat difficult to spot. When you find them, you have two main ways of acquiring scutes from them:

1. Wait for the Armadillo to Drop It Naturally

Sometimes, adult armadillos will drop a scute on their own if you stay nearby. It takes a bit of patience, as scutes don’t drop right away, but the process is easy and doesn’t require much from you. If you gather a few armadillos in a small area, you can even create a basic scute farm. Just let them wander while you work on other things, and come back later to collect what they’ve left behind.

To make this more efficient, you can collect a few armadillos and keep them in a fenced area or enclosed space. That way, instead of wandering off, they’ll stay close and drop scutes over time in one spot.

2. Use a Brush to Collect Scutes Directly

If you don’t want to wait around, the brush is your best tool for collecting scutes quickly. Just walk up to an armadillo while holding a brush and use the interact button; this will instantly make it drop a scute. It’s a simple and harmless method that doesn’t affect the mob in any way.

You can keep doing this as long as your brush holds up, but remember that every use slowly wears it down. A regular brush won’t last forever, though adding the Unbreaking enchantment can help stretch its durability quite a bit. If you’re trying to collect scutes quickly, using a brush is definitely the fastest way. Make sure to carry a few spares or use one with Unbreaking so you don’t run out too soon.

Massive Boulders Ejected by DART Mission Could Complicate Future Asteroid Deflection,"NASA’s DART mission successfully deflected an asteroid but also unleashed high-velocity boulders with unexpected momentum. These chaotic ejecta may alter asteroid spin and orbit, complicating future deflection strategies. A new study highlights the importance of accounting for such forces in planeta",https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/dart-mission-s-boulders-delivered-unexpected-momentum-risking-future-asteroid-defenses-8850171#rss-gadgets-news,NDTV Gadgets 360,,India,"When NASA's DART spacecraft smashed into the asteroid moon Dimorphos in 2022, it was more than proof that a kinetic impactor can nudge the orbit of an asteroid. The impact created about 100 large boulders, some of which had greater than three times the spacecraft's momentum. These high-speed ejecta added unanticipated forces that may complicate future planetary defence efforts. Using data from Italy's LICIACube—an observer satellite deployed during the mission—a University of Maryland-led team tracked the rocks' locations and velocities, revealing a complex and potentially disruptive impact legacy.

DART's Boulder Ejecta Could Disrupt Asteroid Deflection, New Study Warns of Hidden Forces

As per a study in Planetary Science Journal published on July 4, 2025, the team discovered that the boulders weren't scattered randomly but instead clustered into two clear groups, indicating unknown mechanisms at work. Lead author Tony Farnham noted that this added momentum, largely perpendicular to the spacecraft's trajectory, might have tilted Dimorphos' orbit and introduced unpredictable rotation. The largest cluster, travelling southward at shallow angles, likely originated from two larger surface boulders struck moments before the main impact.

Second author Jessica Sunshine explained that DART's solar panels may have shattered these large boulders, Atabaque and Bodhran, creating chaotic debris patterns. In contrast to NASA's earlier Deep Impact mission—which hit a dustier target and produced smoother ejecta—DART's rocky terrain resulted in filamentary structures. The results emphasise how varied the surfaces of asteroids can be and how that variety can affect the practicality of deflection techniques, complicating mission-level planning.

The debris kicked out would transfer momentum, shifting the asteroid's orientation in space — an aspect that had not been accounted for in previous models. Unaccounted for, these forces may have led to future missions missing their deflecti"
NASA Deploys High-Tech Aircraft to Support Texas Flood Relief and Recovery Efforts,"In response to severe flooding near Kerrville, Texas, NASA deployed two aircraft equipped with DyNAMITE and UAVSAR sensors.

The aircrafts are from NASA's Disasters Response Coordination System, and is activated to support the emergency response for flood and is closely working with the Texas Division of Emergency Management, the humanitarian groups Save the Children and GiveDirectly, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Persistent cloud-cover over there has made it quite difficult to capture the clear satellite images.

NASA Deploys Aircraft with Advanced Sensors for Texas Flood Response

As reported by NASA, if this can be done, the NASA's Airborne Science Program can concur a series of flights to fetch observations of te impacted areas. NASA is sharing this data with emergency response teams to inform the search and rescue efforts and help in resource allocation and decision making. WB-57 aircraft departed from Ellington Field on July 8, 2025 for conducting aerial surveys. The aircraft is loaded with the DyNAMITE which is known as Day/Night Airborne Motion Imager for Terrestrial Environments sensor.

Liquid AI, the startup formed by former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers to develop novel AI model architectures beyond the widely-used “Transformers“, today announced the release of LEAP aka the “Liquid Edge AI Platform,” a cross-platform software development kit (SDK) designed to make it easier for developers to integrate small language models (SLMs) directly into mobile applications.

Alongside LEAP, the company also introduced Apollo, a companion iOS app for testing these models locally, furthering Liquid AI’s mission to enable privacy-preserving, efficient AI on consumer hardware.

The LEAP SDK arrives at a time when many developers are seeking alternatives to cloud-only AI services due to concerns over latency, cost, privacy, and offline availability.

LEAP addresses those needs head-on with a local-first approach that allows small models to run directly on-device, reducing dependence on cloud infrastructure.

Built for mobile devs with no prior ML experience required

LEAP is designed for developers who want to build with AI but may not have deep expertise in machine learning.

According to Liquid AI, the SDK can be added to an iOS or Android project with just a few lines of code, and calling a local model is meant to feel as familiar as interacting with a traditional cloud API.

“Our research shows developers are moving beyond cloud-only AI and looking for trusted partners to help them build on-device,” said Ramin Hasani, co-founder and CEO of Liquid AI, in a blog post announcing the news today on Liquid’s website. “LEAP is our answer—a flexible, end-to-end deployment platform built from the ground up to make powerful, efficient, and private edge AI truly accessible.”

Once integrated, developers can select a model from the built-in LEAP model library, which includes compact model"

Autonomous AI coding startup Cognition has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Windsurf, the AI developer tools startup best known for its agentic integrated development environment (IDE). The two companies made the announcement on their respective X accounts on Monday. No acquisition amount was disclosed publicly, nor were specific terms of the deal (both are private startups).

The acquisition gives Cognition access to Windsurf’s core product, brand and remaining team — but not its original CEO or co-founders, several of whom have joined Google in a separate $2.4 billion talent and licensing deal, as The Verge first reported last week.

In a joint video posted to X featuring Cognition CEO Scott Wu and interim Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang, the leaders said they would start by integrating Cognition’s autonomous AI-powered engineer Devin into Windsurf’s IDE.

This combined offering is aimed at enabling developers to plan tasks, delegate code generation to AI agents and review pull requests — all within a single interface.

“This is a perfect fit,” said Wang, who was previously Windsurf’s head of business. “Working with the best engineering team in the space will be an incredible unlock for our product and our go-to-market team.”

In a company blog post titled “The Next Chapter,” Wang directly acknowledged the internal upheaval: “Last week, we lost our founders and our research team.”

He praised the remaining staff for their professionalism during the transition and emphasized that despite the disruption, “so much of what makes us great is intact.”

According to Wang, Windsurf continues to double enterprise revenue quarter-over-quarter and maintains hundreds of thousands of daily active users.

Cognition emphasized that the deal includes full financial participation for Windsurf employees, including waived cliffs"

Amid the big news that Windsurf is being acquired by Cognition (after its founders went to Google), developers interested in AI-powered coding may be on the hunt for new alternatives.

In a bit of fortuitous timing, today also saw Amazon’s release of Kiro, a new agentic integrated development environment (IDE) built to help developers move from prototype to production using AI workflows grounded in structure, planning and engineering rigor.

Kiro uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.0 as the default model backends. Users can switch between them, and future support for other models may be added.

Now in public preview, Kiro runs on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows and Linux for free to start (limited to 50 interactions per user per month), with additional pricing tiers starting at $19 for more features.

Why should developers check out Kiro?

Kiro aims to bridge the gap between “vibe coding” — allowing AI to generate full blocks of code or entire software processes and applications from plain text instructions, typically for rapid prototyping and iteration — and the more demanding process of delivering secure, maintainable and scalable applications in real-world environments.

The tool combines AI agents with project specifications, technical architecture and automated task management to support a complete software development lifecycle inside a single interface.

Kiro vs. Q Developer?

But didn’t Amazon already have its own AI-code completion tool, Q Developer? Yes, and that’s still available.

So why launch a whole new product and brand name that offers some of the same functionality? Sources at Amazon told VentureBeat that “Kiro is a general-purpose agentic IDE for developers to work with any platform of their choice,” as opposed to Q Developer, which is more limited in its support for third-party IDEs, restr"

Now, instead of seeing a headline from a major publication, users will see multiple news publishers’ logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.

The app warns that these summaries are generated with AI, “which can make mistakes.”

Image Credits:Google

The feature is not yet appearing for all news stories within the Google app, indicating this change is likely still a test. (Google has been asked for comment about the extent of the rollout, but has not responded.) In tests, TechCrunch was able to view the AI summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S.

In addition to the summaries, Google has been trying out other ways to present the news displayed in Discover. Though not flagged as powered by AI, some stories will include a set of bullet points below the headline or will be grouped with similar news.

For instance, a story about President Trump’s Ukraine deal also included links to other stories about Trump’s latest actions. Meanwhile, a story from The Washington Post about ICE was followed by bullet points that summarized the story’s content.

The update to the search app comes as a number of publishers have been experimenting with AI on their own sites, including The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, USA Today, and others.

Crystalline Ice Discovered in Space: New Study Reveals Hidden Order in Cosmic Ice,"A groundbreaking study from University College London and the University of Cambridge reveals that water ice in space, long believed to be completely amorphous due to extreme cold, may actually contain up to 25% crystalline structure.

On Earth, ice freezes into a neat crystal lattice, but in the deep cold of space it was assumed to form a completely amorphous (glassy) solid. A new study by University College London and Cambridge scientists challenges this picture. Their computer simulations and X-ray tests on cosmic “low-density” ice suggest it actually contains tiny crystalline grains. In some models roughly 20–25% of the ice was in crystal form, overturning the long-held view that space ice is entirely structureless.

Simulations reveal hidden nanocrystals

According to the paper, computer simulations of space ice showed it contains nanocrystals. In one approach, researchers cooled virtual water to –120 °C at different rates to form model “ice cubes.” Depending on the cooling speed, the simulated ice ranged from fully amorphous to partly ordered. Structures with roughly 16–19% of the molecules in tiny crystal clusters best matched published X-ray data for low-density ice. In another simulation, thousands of nanometer-sized ice grains were packed together and then the remaining water molecules were randomized. This produced ice about 25% crystalline, yet still reproduced the known diffraction pattern.

In laboratory experiments the team also made actual low-density amorphous ice by vapor deposition and gentle compression. When these samples were slowly warmed to crystallize, the resulting ice showed a “memory” of its formation method.

Implications for planets and origins of life

The findings give “a good idea of what the most common form of ice in the Universe looks like at an atomic level,” which is important for models of planet and galaxy formation. They also bear on theories of life's origins. Partly crystalline ice has less internal space to trap organic molecules, potentially making it a less efficient vehicle for amino acids or other prebiotic compounds. However, Dr. Davies no"
The rights to Fyre Festival sold on eBay for 245K,"Billy McFarland, the convicted criminal behind Fyre Festival, sold the rights to the infamous brand on eBay.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/the-rights-to-fyre-festival-sold-on-ebay-for-245k/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"Billy McFarland, the fraudster who brought you Fyre Festival, has sold the rights to the brand on eBay for $245,300. We do not yet know who the buyer is or what they plan to do with such cursed IP.

Fyre Festival was a downright disaster. What was supposed to be a luxury music festival ended up stranding guests on an island in the Bahamas. Instead of lavish villas and gourmet meals, the festival’s clientele, which included wealthy millennial influencers, got flimsy tents and famously unappetizing cheese sandwiches.

McFarland was later convicted of financial crimes due to his role in the festival, serving about three and a half years before he was released in 2022. But McFarland has not seemed to have learned his lesson. He tried organizing a second Fyre Festival, which was supposed to take place this summer in Mexico with tickets ranging between $1,400 and $1.1 million.

The second Fyre Festival never happened. Playa del Carmen, the Mexican city where McFarland said the festival would take place, claimed that there had not been any record of planning for the event, which did not have a permit. McFarland denied this, but announced a few weeks later that he would sell the Fyre Festival brand.

“Since 2017, FYRE has dominated headlines, documentaries, and conversations as one of the world’s most talked-about music festivals,” McFarland wrote, failing to mention that the festival garnered so much attention due to its colossal failure. “There is a clear path for operators and entrepreneurs with strong domain expertise to build FYRE into a global force in entertainment, media, fashion, CPG, and more.”

The eBay auction says that a portion of the proceeds of the sale will go toward restitution — but McFarland owes $26 million, so this $245,300 sale isn’t going to make much of an impact."
Lucid Motors will roll out hands-free highway driving this month,"Lucid Motors joins the likes of Ford, General Motors, and Tesla in offering an advanced driver assistance system that allows for hands-free driving.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/lucid-motors-will-roll-out-hands-free-highway-driving-this-month/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"Lucid Motors is set to roll out a software update on July 30 that will enable hands-free highway driving on its Air sedans, a major step forward for the company’s advanced driver assistance system.

The rollout will put Lucid Motors on a short list of companies that have made hands-free driving possible in the United States. Ford has a system called BlueCruise, General Motors has Super Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz has Drive Pilot, although it’s not as widely available. In the right conditions and in cars equipped with an in-cabin camera, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) can also be used hands-free.

Lucid says the hands-free update is only coming to the Air sedans for now, with an update rolling out to owners of the new Gravity SUV slated for later this year. (The company has barely started shipping Gravity SUVs anyway, with Cox Automotive reporting this week that only five were delivered in the second quarter.) The system is also only available to customers who bought an Air equipped with the $2,500 “Dream Drive Pro” package, which includes a “comprehensive suite of 32 sensors” that includes lidar, radar, cameras, and ultrasonics.

The company declined to say how many customers have purchased the Dream Drive Pro package to date. Lucid has delivered around 20,000 cars since 2021.

Drivers will have to keep their eyes on the road ahead and be ready to take over at any moment, much like the competing driver assistance systems. Lucid says this will be done with a camera-based system in the car that sits on top of the steering column. They’ll also only be able to use the hands-free system on “compatible” divided highways. TechCrunch has asked for more specifics and will update this story when Lucid provides them."

WeTransfer was forced to respond this week after changes to its terms of service (TOS) triggered major backlash from users who believed the new language granted the service access to users' files to train AI.

""We don't use machine learning or any form of AI to process content shared via WeTransfer, nor do we sell content or data to any third parties,"" a WeTransfer spokesperson told BBC News on Tuesday.

WeTransfer clarified this after users noticed recent changes to its TOS page, which initially said the following policy would go into effect in August (via Wayback Machine on July 14, 2025).

Ive tested 25+ robot vacuums. Here are 6 Id actually recommend buying in 2025.,"I continuously test new robovacs from Shark, Roborock, and iRobot, and these are the best robot vacuums of 2025, so far.",https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums,Mashable,,Technology,"The robot vacuum market is crowded. Consider the following nitty-gritty criteria to help narrow your options:

Smart mapping: This is a non-negotiable at this point, considering robot vacuums with smart mapping can be scored for under $200 if you find them on sale. Often LiDAR (laser) based, smart mapping refers to the navigational tech that allows a robot vacuum to create and remember your home's layout. This is how it can clean specific rooms on demand, or spot clean a certain zone within a room that you've selected in the mobile app. Small obstacle avoidance is a slightly pricier, but seriously worthwhile extension of navigational technology. It helps the robot vacuum detect and avoid items on the floor that other robot vacs would get stuck on, like phone chargers or shoes. For a robot vacuum to be worthwhile, it needs to get to the right place — just saying.

Suction power: A vacuum is the one purchase that you hope sucks a lot. Suction power is typically measured in Pascals (Pa), averaging between 5,000 to 8,000 Pa for any decent contender since around 2022. The ante is being upped, though: Multiple 2024 flagship models clocked between 10,000 Pa and 12,000 Pa, and several 2025 flagships are casually hitting between 20,000 Pa and 22,000 Pa. Stronger suction will be needed to pick up heavier pieces of debris like pellet cat litter or popcorn (be sure to set a barrier around Lego pieces) and to yank patted-down pet hair from carpet or rug fibers.

Floor type: Expanding on the point above, carpeting and rugs require stronger suction than hard floors, as well as an extra-wide or self-cleaning brush roll to prevent hair from wrapping. Folks in homes with multiple floor types might consider a bigger, sturdier robovac with large wheels and floor type sensors that can hoist itself over door mats, rugs of varying piles, and transitions from carpet to hard floors.

Automatic emptying: Because robot vacuums are typically under four inches tall, their onboard dust bins are "

It can be frustrating to swipe through your Facebook Feed and be inundated with accounts dedicated to stealing other people's work, impersonating people, and generally participating in copycat antics. But Facebook is trying to put a stop to that slop.

In April, Meta implemented changes aimed at improving the Feed experience by reducing spammy content tactics used to boost views, gain followers, and monetize inauthentically, ultimately leading to a less enjoyable scrolling experience. The platform announced it would reduce the reach of, or completely remove, accounts that engage in this behavior, while boosting visibility for those who share original content.

In a Monday blog post, Meta said it ""took action on"" 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior during the first half of 2025 by ""applying measures ranging from demoting their comments and reducing the distribution of their content to preventing these accounts from monetizing."" The platform also took down 10 million profiles impersonating large content producers.

This Guy Attached 21 Chef’s Knives to a Slicing Robot Arm to Determine Which One Is Best,"Certified kitchen knife nerd Scott Heimendinger used a robot arm on multiple chef’s knives to collect 100,000 data points about which blades cut most efficiently. He’s ranked them from best to worst.",https://www.wired.com/story/quantified-knife-project/,Wired,,Technology,"After the fifth tomato, I had to know how my knife did. Without judgment, Heimendinger announced that it placed ""second to last in the cohort."" I felt responsibility for this knife, and a little embarrassment, until I remembered his knives came straight out of the box and into the testing process with an unblemished factory edge. My knife, on the other hand, had been in regular use in my test kitchen for more than six months receiving only the occasional honing. Plus, I noted protectively that these tomatoes appeared bigger than the ones he used during his main battery of testing.

He continued through the other four foods: potatoes, cheese cubes, baby carrots, and King's Hawaiian rolls, the latter chosen for their extremely uniform interior.

Understandably, my knife didn't fare particularly well, but I was able to get an appreciation for Scott's testing and data-gathering process.

Even with the robot, collecting this amount of data took a lot of time. Every piece of food needed to be loaded and unloaded from the scale, the knife wiped, cleaned, and dried after every stroke, the room kept cool, the whole thing happening during that monotonous bender of a weekend, Don Henley and Tears for Fears playing over and over.

Once he got all that data and made dozens and dozens of charts and graphs, what did he learn?

Our Favorite Bottle Washers for Keeping Your Baby Bottles Safe and Clean (2025),Keeping baby bottles clean and sterilized is a chore. We tested automatic bottle washers to see if they're worth buying.,https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-bottle-washers/,Wired,,Technology,"I like to think of the Baby Brezza Bottle Washer Pro as the pioneer of bottle washers. It paved the way for what I think will be a booming baby product in the next few years, and the Brezza specifically is consistently a top seller across retailers, so it felt like a natural to try first.

The Brezza does what it promises. It washes and sterilizes well, and it uses less water than many competitors—great if you're working with limited filtered or purified water. Like most bottle washers I’ve tried, some pieces may still come out a little wet even after the dry cycle, but that’s pretty standard.

With that said, this bottle washer comes with some trade-offs—the biggest being its size. Not only does it look (and sound) like a rocket ship on the counter, but you also need to take into consideration the clearance needed above the machine so that steam won’t warp your cabinets. For something that takes up that much space, it’s surprisingly particular about how you load it. The racks are fixed and shallow, which works fine for standard bottles, but wide bottles or pump flanges can feel cramped or tip over if you’re not meticulous. And taking the lid off when it’s full can be awkward; it’s easy to knock things over if you’re not careful.

If counter real estate is limited or you need flexibility for various bottle sizes and pump parts, it can be a bit picky, but if you’re looking for a dependable, hands-off solution to bottle cleaning, the Baby Brezza is a solid pick."

Google Pixel Tablet for $399: Google has a spotty history with Android tablets, going from the highs of the Nexus 7 to the, well, distinct averageness of the Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The 10.2-inch LCD screen is one of the highlights; the size and 439-gram weight are just right for carrying around, and Google’s fuss-free Android software is simple and logical. However, the Google Tensor G2 processor can get hot under strain, and there’s only 8 GB of RAM. What makes it special is the Speaker Dock, which turns the Pixel Tablet into a big smart home display. But unlike the Nest Hub Max, you can take the screen off the dock and use it separately. The Charging Dock’s speaker is loud and sounds excellent, and the Pixel Tablet’s microphones and large screen make using Gemini so easy. It's especially great if you are in the Google Home smart home ecosystem, as you can set the lock screen to double as a control panel for all your devices. Used alone, the Pixel Tablet can’t compete with the OnePlus Pad 3 or Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE, but with the dock, it becomes a unique dual-use product with an emphasis on the smart home.

Tech Billionaires Back Erebor in the Wake of Silicon Valley Bank Collapse,"Funded by Anduril cofounder Palmer Luckey and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale, the new bank—named, like their companies, after Tolkien lore—aims to serve startups in crypto, AI, and defense.",https://www.wired.com/story/palmer-luckey-joe-lonsdale-bank-erebor/,Wired,,Technology,"Palmer Luckey, cofounder of the weapons manufacturer Anduril, along with firms connected to Palantir cofounders Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, are investing in a new bank that is aiming to fill a gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse two years ago. The venture is expected to be backed by upwards of $250 million in funding from Luckey, Lonsdale’s venture firm 8VC, Thiel’s Founders Fund, crypto-focused VC Haun Ventures, and several angel investors whose identities are not yet publicly known.

Like Anduril and Palantir, Erebor Bank is named after a term coined by J.R.R. Tolkien. (Introduced in The Hobbit, it’s the name of a mountain where the murderous dragon Smaug hoards gold and jewels.) The bank’s organizers and backers have remained tight-lipped about their vision. But their national bank charter application filed in June with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as well as interviews with more than a dozen industry sources, suggest the organizers are leveraging current regulatory openness in banking, as well as their political power, to build a crypto-focused Silicon Valley Bank successor made in their image.

The leadership team named in Erebor’s application includes Michael Hagedorn, an experienced bank executive who will serve as Erebor’s president; Trevor Capozza, head of operations at Palmer Luckey’s family office; and co-CEOs Owen Rapaport, cofounder of crypto compliance platform Aer Compliance, and Jacob Hirshman, who has served in regulatory and advisory roles at the stablecoin provider Circle. Erin Gleason, chief communications officer of Founders Fund, told WIRED that Thiel was “not involved” in the deal and that Founders Fund invested $1 million into Erebor. Luckey and Lonsdale are not named in the nonconfidential sections of Erebor’s filings; the application notes that major shareholders will not be involved in day-to-day operations.

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.

xAI has offered a couple more fixes for “issues” with its Grok AI chatbot, promising it will no longer name itself “Hitler” or base its responses on searches for what xAI head Elon Musk has said.

According to an X post earlier today, the chatbot’s latest update sets new instructions that its responses “must stem from your independent analysis, not from any stated beliefs of past Grok, Elon Musk, or xAI. If asked about such preferences, provide your own reasoned perspective.”

The changes follow more than a week of controversy for Grok. In recent days, multiple reports showed that when asked its opinion about hot-button topics like Israel and Palestine, immigration, and abortion, the chatbot first searched for Musk’s opinion on the matter before responding. In its Tuesday post, xAI said that the reason for this was that when asked about its views, “the model reasons that as an AI it doesn’t have an opinion but knowing it was Grok 4 by xAI searches to see what xAI or Elon Musk might have said on a topic to align itself with the company.”

The company also addressed another controversy from over the weekend, in which Grok 4 Heavy, the chatbot’s $300-per-month subscription product, responded that its surname was “Hitler.” In the company’s statement, xAI said that it was due to media headlines responding to yet an earlier incident: Grok going off the rails in a multi-day series of tirades where it denigrated Jews and praised Hitler. (It also posted graphic sexual threats against a user.) Since Grok doesn’t have a surname, said xAI, it “searches the internet leading to undesirable results, such as when its searches picked up a viral meme where it called itself ‘MechaHitler.’” The new instructions should prevent this, according to the company.

Grok’s antisemitism isn’t limited to the recent past — in May"
Our biggest questions about ChromeOS and Android merging,"Sameer Samat, Google's head of Android ecosystems, recently confirmed that Android and ChromeOS will be merged into a single platform, reigniting a slew of questions about the future of the operating systems. Combining them makes sense. It made sense way back in 2013, and it was first supposed to ha",https://www.theverge.com/google/707041/google-chromeos-android-os-merger-questions-phones-chromebooks-laptops-tablets,The Verge,,Technology,"is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.

What is the point of merging ChromeOS and Android?

Android has an enormous app ecosystem, but many of those apps still struggle on larger screens, like tablets. And Android doesn’t have great multitasking or window management, which are both important on large displays. ChromeOS, on the other hand, does browser stuff and window management really well, but doesn’t really support non-web apps.

Chromebooks have been able to run Android apps for a long time, which helps fill some of the compatibility gaps. But those apps often suck to use on a laptop with a mouse cursor. Some apps are too small and don’t adapt to running on a bigger screen; the Android Slack app can’t show two threads side-by-side on a Chromebook like the desktop app can. And some are just wonky, like Discord not always responding to mouse clicks. Spotify works fine, but its mobile app looks a little sparse on a large laptop screen, and you have to remember to click and hold instead of using secondary clicks (which just feels unnatural on a trackpad or mouse).

Why did this take so long?

Talk of a unified Android and ChromeOS has been going on for well over 10 years. It’s seemed like the logical next step for both of Google’s operating systems, yet it never made much headway. There was speculation for a while that Google’s experimental open-source Fuchsia OS might be that unified platform, but after years of rumors, teases, and job postings — it ended up on some Nest Hubs.

But seriously, why now?

Part of it is surely that Arm chips are finally fast enough for laptops. Arm-based Chromebooks are not new (there was a Samsung one back in 2012), but until very recently, good Chromebooks came with Intel Core i3 and i5 processors. The MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chip in the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 (Google’s new flagship) is powerful enough to o"

The new third generation RX1R III arrives with the same 35mm full-frame Exmor R sensor as its predecessor, but with a bump from 42.4 to 61 megapixels. It also benefits from Sony’s latest Bionz XR and AI image processors to deliver better autofocus that can track the movement of human bodies and more accurately focus on their heads and eyes.

The RX1R III will be available sometime in July for approximately $5,099.99, according to Sony. That’s considerably more expensive than the RX1R II, which launched in 2015 for $3,300. The RX1R III’s compact size and Zeiss Sonnar T 35mm F2 lens puts the camera in competition with the $4,899.95 medium format Fujifilm GFX100RF and the $5,995 full-frame Leica Q3 – both of which also feature fixed lenses.

To compensate for that lens limitation, the RX1R III includes a Step Crop Shooting function that allows photographers to switch between 35mm, 50mm, and 70mm focal lengths achieved through sensor cropping. The camera also features a macro mode activated by a ring on the lens that can be used to focus on subjects as close as 20cm.

The camera has a body made of magnesium alloy. To help make the RX1R III as light and portable as possible, Sony is now using a fixed screen on the back that can no longer be tilted up and down. The change means you may find yourself having to contort your body when trying to capture low-angle shots using the camera’s screen or 2.36 million dot OLED electronic view finder.

Sony is once again positioning this camera as a high quality shooter that’s far less cumbersome to carry than larger mirrorless options or DSLRs, and its performance reflects that. Shooting speeds max out at just five frames per second, and the RX1R III can capture"
Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab is worth $12B in seed round,"Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati says that her new startup, Thinking Machines Lab, was valued at $12 billion in its seed round.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, officially closed a $2 billion seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz on Monday, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

The deal, which includes participation from NVIDIA, Accel, ServiceNow, CISCO, AMD, and Jane Street, values the startup at $12 billion, the spokesperson said.

Several outlets reported in June that Thinking Machines Lab was close to closing this $2B funding round at a $10 billion valuation, but, apparently, that valuation has shot up in the last month.

The deal marks one of the largest seed rounds — or first funding rounds — in Silicon Valley history, representing the massive investor appetite to back promising new AI labs. Thinking Machines Lab is less than a year old and has yet to reveal what it’s working on.

However, Murati peeled back the curtain on the company’s first product a bit in a post on X Tuesday, claiming that the startup plans to unveil its work in the “next couple months,” and it will include a “significant open source offering.” Murati also said the product will be useful for researchers and startups building custom AI models.

“Soon, we’ll also share our best science to help the research community better understand frontier AI systems,” said Murati.

Thinking Machines Lab exists to empower humanity through advancing collaborative general intelligence.

It’s unclear if Murati means that Thinking Machines Lab will release an open AI model, as some of OpenAI’s other competitors have done to undercut the ChatGPT-maker’s offerings. A Thinking Machines Lab spokesperson declined to comment further.

Since Murati launched her venture, Thinking Machines Lab has attracted some of her former coworkers at OpenAI, including Joh"
AV startup Pronto.ai acquires off-road autonomous vehicle rival SafeAI,Pronto.ai CEO Anthony Levandowski said the move is meant to help bolster his company's ranks with like-minded talent and complimentary technology.,https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/av-startup-pronto-ai-acquires-off-road-autonomous-vehicle-rival-safeai/,TechCrunch,,Technology,"The Venn diagram of engineers that know a little bit about AI, self driving, and mining has a small intersection. Pronto.ai CEO Anthony Levandowski wants as many of those people as possible. And an acquisition is helping him achieve that goal.

The San Francisco-based startup, which has developed a self-driving system designed for haulage trucks and other off-road vehicles used at construction and mining sites, has acquired competitor Safe AI, TechCrunch has learned.

Terms of the deal have not been disclosed. However, Levandowski said the acquisition is a talent and technology play. The bulk of the small 12-person startup’s engineering team and its IP will come over to Pronto. A source familiar with the deal said Safe AI acquisition price was in “the millions.”

“In the autonomous haulage system space, there’s really kind of two players — it’s SafeAI and us,” Levandowski told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that SafeAI and Pronto have taken different approaches to the market. “We’ve been growing a ton and needed to add more people and resources to the team, so it made sense to purchase them … have more wood behind fewer arrows so that we could grow faster.”

Pronto, which was co-founded with Ognen Stojanovski in 2018, uses advanced sensors, cameras and artificial intelligence to operate haul trucks autonomously. Pronto also uses Pollen Mobile, a peer-to-peer open source mobile data network the startup launched in 2022 that allows it to exchange data anonymously and at high speeds without relying on legacy carriers. Pollen is used to support sites with little to no connectivity.

Pronto has kept its team fairly lean at about 40 people. The SafeAI acquisition will help Pronto serve more customers, including internationally, Levandowski said. Last year, Pronto extended a partnership with Heidelberg Materials North America, one of the largest build materials and cement producers in the world, following a pilot program at the company’s Bridgeport Quarry in Texa"

Chasing 204 for victory in Jamaica, the West Indies second innings lasted just 14.3 overs as they were dismissed for the the second-lowest total in Test history, only just surpassing New Zealand's 26 against England from 1955.

The West Indies' previous historic low score was 47 against England in 2004.

The embarassing collapse - Mitchell Starc (6-9) taking the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history and Scott Boland (3-2) claiming a hat-trick - wrapped up a 3-0 series sweep for Australia.

It prompted a statement from Cricket West Indies president Kishore Shallow on Tuesday, which said: ""As an immediate step, I have advised the chair of the cricket strategy and officiating committee to convene an emergency meeting to review the recent Test series against Australia, particularly the final match.

OnePlus' flagship phone is a solid alternative to the Galaxy S25 Ultra - here's why,"The OnePlus 13 sets a high bar for every other premium phone this year. Right now, you can get it for $50 off.",https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-flagship-phone-is-a-solid-alternative-to-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-heres-why/,ZDNet,,Technology,"ZDNET's key takeaways The OnePlus 13 is a snappy, nearly no-compromise phone that typically lists at $999.

A Snapdragon 8 Elite, paired with a 6,000mAh battery and 80W fast charging, is a recipe for endurance success.

IP69 is almost excessive, but you'll appreciate it when least expected. View now at OnePlus View now at Best Buy View now at Amazon more buying choices

Right now, you can buy the OnePlus 13 from Amazon at a $50 discount, whether you choose the 256GB or 512GB variant.

It's not often that I review a smartphone in the first few calendar weeks and feel confident in calling it a ""Phone of the Year"" contender. But when I tested the OnePlus 13 back in January, that's precisely what happened.

Whether Google finally launches a Pixel Pro Fold with a flagship camera system this summer, or Apple releases a thinner iPhone in the fall, the OnePlus 13 will likely still be on my mind when the year-end nominations are due.

Also: Yes, an Android tablet finally made me reconsider my iPad Pro loyalty

There's a lot going for the latest flagship phone, from the more secure (and reliable) ultrasonic fingerprint sensor to the IP69 rating to the 6,000mAh Silicon NanoStack battery. It's also one of the first phones in North America to feature Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which promises improvements to performance, efficiency, and AI workloads.

I tested the OnePlus 13 alongside my iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL to see exactly how the Android phone stacked up against one of the best phones so far in 2025. In a few ways, the OnePlus 13 falls short, but in many ways, it puts the iPhone and Pixel to shame.

When I first unboxed the OnePlus 13 and held it in my hand, my reaction was audible. Allow me to geek out here: The slightly curved glass, the slimness of the phone, and the overall appearance made my then-four-month-old iPhone look and feel outdated. It's as if OnePlus made the iPhone 17 Air before Apple did.

However, what sells the OnePlus 13 de"

As some regulated enterprises cautiously expand their use of AI, platform and model makers are starting to offer bespoke versions to specific industries.

Anthropic is making its first step into that direction with the new Claude for Financial Services, essentially a special version of its Claude for Enterprise tier, that could soothe some of the fears of the sector around interoperability and tool use. Anthropic will also provide pre-built connectors to data providers, opening up discoverability routes for tools on Claude.

Jonathan Pelosi, head of industry for financial services at Anthropic, told VentureBeat that Anthropic models “were already particularly well-suited for financial workloads and we’ve been tailoring them to get better and better.” But while the Claude models offer enterprise solutions for financial services firms, Pelosi said the sector was also looking for more features from the Claude chat interface.

“Unlike some competitors in the space who built a consumer app that became a sensation, or they built these new video generators and meme generators, that’s just never our focus,” Pelosi said. “We are enterprise first, so our models are uniquely well-suited to perform best in class against complicated enterprise workloads, which means complicated quantitative analysis, complex data extraction for the financial services industry at scale.”

Claude for Financial Services would offer users additional rate limits, especially since, Pelosi noted, many analysts often find themselves quickly hitting capacity limitations due to the size of their workloads. Unlike Claude for Enterprise, this financial services-specific platform will also include pre-built MCP connectors to financial data providers like FactSet, PitchBook, S&P Capital IQ and Morningstar, among others, and implementation support from An"

Perplexity, the AI-powered search engine that competes with Google and ChatGPT, has partnered with identity verification company SheerID to offer up to two years of free premium service to more than 264 million students worldwide, the companies announced Monday.

The deal tackles a key challenge for AI companies: providing educational access to expensive tools while preventing discount fraud. Perplexity is betting heavily on the education market as competition for users intensifies across the industry.

Under the agreement, verified students can access Perplexity Pro, normally priced at $20 per month, through SheerID’s verification platform that connects to more than 200,000 authoritative data sources across 190 countries. The program will be available to all university and post-secondary students globally where SheerID provides verification, making 264 million students eligible worldwide. The offering includes features like cited research, in-depth reports, and interactive AI applications.

The partnership comes as AI adoption surges among students, with 86% of U.S. students using AI tools to support their studies, according to the companies. However, the rapid growth has sparked concerns about academic integrity and the need for AI tools designed specifically for educational use.

How advanced verification technology stops sophisticated student discount fraud

SheerID, a Portland-based company founded in 2011, has built its business around solving a persistent problem for retailers and service providers: verifying that consumers actually belong to groups eligible for special discounts, such as students, military personnel, or healthcare workers.

"Ranking CFB's best coaches, from Ryan Day and Dabo Swinney to ... Rhett Lashlee?",Is Ryan Day a genius or could anyone win at Ohio State? We break down 20 years of sideline overachievers.,https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45739570/ranking-best-college-football-coaches-last-20-years,ESPN,,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

Back in May, ESPN's team of college football reporters voted on the sport's best coaches for 2025. The results were about as you would expect: Start with the three active guys who have most recently won national titles (Georgia's Kirby Smart, Ohio State's Ryan Day, Clemson's Dabo Swinney), move on to guys with recent top-five finishes or national title game appearances (Notre Dame's Marcus Freeman, Texas' Steve Sarkisian, Oregon's Dan Lanning, Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Penn State's James Franklin), then squeeze in a couple of long-term overachievers at the end (Utah's Kyle Whittingham, Iowa State's Matt Campbell).

The rankings made plenty of sense, but I couldn't help but notice that the top eight coaches on the list all work for some of the richest, most well-supported programs in the country. There are some epic pressures associated with leading these programs -- just ask Day -- but there are also major advantages. It might only take a good head coach to do great things in those jobs, while at programs with smaller alumni bases or lesser historic track records, it might take a great coach to do merely good things. They're such different jobs that it's almost impossible to even know how to compare the performance of, say, Matt Campbell to Steve Sarkisian. Could Campbell have led Texas to back-to-back CFP semifinals? Could Sark have brought ISU its first two AP top-15 finishes?

The May rankings made me want to see if there were a way to apply stats to the conversation. If you think about it, we're basically measuring two things when we're gauging coach performance: overall quality and quality relative to the expectations of the job. I thought it would be fun to come up with a blend of those two things and see what the results told us.

Performance versus expectation

Gauging overall performance is easy enough. You could simply look at win percentage, and it would tell you quite a bit. From 2015 to 2024, the active coaches with the best FBS w"

I've grown rather attached to my work MacBook Pro. I use it every day, take it with me when I need to work on the go, and rely on its outstanding battery life to stay as far away from outlets as possible. I've tried using an iPad instead of the MacBook Pro before, but have yet to find one that strikes the right balance of portability, value, and performance -- until the M3 iPad Air showed up at my door.

Also: I'm a Windows user, but the MacBook Air M4 could be my new primary laptop at this price

The latest iPad Air is Apple's most capable tablet after the iPad Pro. It features the M3 Silicon chip, which is leaps and bounds ahead of my M1 MacBook Pro in performance, speed, and power, and supports Apple Intelligence. At this point, here's how the Apple iPad lineup stands in performance, from weakest to strongest: iPad 11th Gen, iPad Mini 7, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. So the question is, who should buy the Air?

Admittedly, there are no significant differences between the 2024 iPad Air and the 2025 model, as was made evident in my testing. This year's iPad Air is an iterative upgrade that takes the device from the M2 processor to the M3, with no new display capabilities or camera features. That's not a bad thing, per se.

Apple AirTags been a game changer in my life, saving me countless hours searching for my keys, wallet, and passport. But as handy as they are, they're not without their flaws.

I've collected my fair share of multitools and gadgets, but I've lost track of how often I've needed one -- only to realize it's sitting at home or in the car. Carrying a full toolbox everywhere just isn't practical.

What I do have with me almost all the time, though, is my keychain -- and it turns out, it's the perfect way to keep essential tools within reach.

Also: Are Amazon Basics tools worth it? My verdict after testing the top-sellers for weeks

My keychain is the one bit of kit I get asked the most questions about. People are often surprised at the things I carry around. I guess most people just carry their keys on their keychains. Weird.

Here's a tour of what I carry on mine. Don't feel like you need everything on this list. Remember, the beauty of this approach is that you can customize your EDC to suit your needs.

1. KeySmart Air

The KeySmart Air is the core of my keychain. This device acts as both the main key loop and also as a way to attach an Apple AirTag (also on sale for $23 now on Amazon) to my stuff, so I don't lose my entire keychain.

The best power banks you can buy in 2025: Expert tested and reviewed,"I tested the best power banks, from big units that can keep laptops running for hours to ones that can survive being in water.",https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-power-banks/,ZDNet,,Technology,"Almost everyone I know owns at least one power bank, and the ubiquity of these portable chargers means that you can pick up cheap units in gas stations and dollar stores. But my extensive testing suggests that these are false economy, and you're very likely buying something that at best won't last long, or at worse could even be dangerous.

This is why I recommend buying power banks from reputable brands. Don't worry -- I still work to keep those brands honest by extensively testing every power bank using an array of gadgets to make sure that they do what they say they do on the box. If the power bank claims water resistance, I test that, and if there a durability claim, rest assured that is also tested to a high level, too.

What is the best portable charger right now?

I've rigorously tested hundreds -- yes, literally hundreds -- of portable chargers in recent years, putting me in the perfect position to identify which ones truly deserve your hard-earned money. It takes a long time to test a power bank, testing that involves power meters to measure capacity and power output, testing durability claims in real world tests, followed by a chunk of time using the item on a day to day basis. But at the end of this, I know just how good a particular power bank is.

Also: Best MagSafe battery packs of 2025: Expert tested

My pick for the best power bank overall goes to the Anker Nano 10,000 mAh for its portability, quality construction (this power bank has been knocked about by me in a handful of countries), the fact that it has USB-C and USB-A ports which means it caters to both old and new devices. And to top it all off, it comes with a super handy built-in USB-C cable. And you get all that for $30.

While the Anker Nano is my favorite, there are plenty of other options with different price points, features, and brands in mind. For example, if you're looking for a power bank with sheer power, the Cuktech P-series 25,000 mAh can give you several recharges of a smartphone"

Can Brian Kelly and LSU win it all?,"In his fourth season with the program, the coach is facing pressure to win a national championship.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45716712/brian-kelly-lsu-national-championship-aspirations,ESPN,,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

BATON ROUGE, La. -- There is a quiet anticipation inside the newly expanded LSU football operations center, even though the season is still months away. In the weight room, players go through the summer conditioning program, hollering encouragement and straining to hit unique benchmarks assigned to them. They have a singular focus taking hold.

On the screens around them, when they break down the end of a workout or when they text each other in group chats, all they see is ""1-0."" Everyone in the building knows what that means: Beat Clemson in the season opener.

Upstairs, Ya'el Lofton bustles about her desk, waiting for coach Brian Kelly to arrive. Lofton has worked at LSU for more than 35 years -- including nearly 25 as the executive assistant to the head coach. ""You know,"" she says with a big smile, ""every head coach I have worked for has won a national championship.""

Her quiet anticipation, of course, is for Kelly to join Nick Saban, Les Miles and Ed Orgeron as a national champion. LSU went into the transfer portal, flush with more money to spend, and brought in one of the top classes in the country. Veteran quarterback Garrett Nussmeier returns, along with a more experienced defensive staff.

Every move has been calculated and points to this being a championship-or-bust season. But that all starts Aug. 30. LSU has never won an opener under Kelly. In fact, the Tigers have begun each of their past five seasons with a loss. So Kelly isn't talking about the end of the season. He is just talking about the beginning.

""I've never really been, 'It's all or nothing,'"" Kelly says. ""This year is a change in our philosophy, in that we have to focus on Clemson. Our focus has to be playing our very best in that first week.""

WHEN KELLY HELD his first team meeting in January, he had the newcomers -- transfers and early enrollee freshmen -- introduce themselves and explain why they wanted to come to LSU. Kelly says every transfer said the same thing: "

The Kansas City Chiefs accomplished their final major objective for this offseason, reaching agreement with right guard Trey Smith on a four-year, $94 million contract extension, a record-setting deal that makes him the highest-paid interior lineman in league history, sources told ESPN on Tuesday.

Smith's deal includes $70 million guaranteed, the most guaranteed money ever awarded to an NFL guard.

Smith, 26, entered Tuesday as the lone NFL player who was still on the franchise tag, a move the Chiefs made Feb. 28 to prevent him from reaching free agency. General manager Brett Veach and coach Andy Reid made the decision -- which restricted Smith to a one-year deal worth $23.4 million -- so the team could continue to negotiate with him in hopes of signing him to a new contract before Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline for franchised players to agree to long-term contracts.

Chiefs' Smith now tops exclusive list With Trey Smith's new contract, the Chiefs are the only team to pay multiple interior offensive linemen at least $50 million guaranteed.

Smith was one of two players to receive the franchise tag this year. The other, wide receiver Tee Higgins, reached agreement on a long-term contract with the Cincinnati Bengals in March. This will be the first season since 2015 when no players will play the season on a franchise tag, according to ESPN Research.

Retaining Smith completed the Chiefs' latest revamp of their offensive line, the team's biggest mission this offseason to better support quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Within minutes of the deal's agreement, Mahomes used his X account to post a beaming face with smiling eyes emoji in reaction to Smith's extension.

Washington Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin said he's frustrated and disappointed with the talks on a contract extension, saying they're entering crunch time to get a new deal done.

McLaurin, talking to reporters after shooting a commercial Tuesday, said ""without any progression discussions it's kind of hard to see how I step on the field.""

""I've been pretty frustrated, not going to lie,"" McLaurin told reporters. ""Everything that has transpired has been pretty disappointing. I want to continue my career here, I've created my life here, so I want to be here. Just to see how things have played out has been disappointing.""

However, McLaurin, who has surpassed 1,000 yards receiving for five consecutive seasons, also said, ""I want to be here. I want to make that abundantly clear.""

McLaurin skipped the team's mandatory minicamp last month. In 2022, he signed a three-year extension worth $68,364,000. This year, he has a base salary of $15.5 million with a cap hit of $25.5 million.

McLaurin said he and the Commanders have not any discussions in the past month. He said he hasn't decided whether he will report to training camp without his contract situation resolved.

His comments come a day after fellow Ohio State alumnus Garrett Wilson agreed to a four-year, $130 million extension with the New York Jets. The $32.5 million average annual value ranks fifth among NFL wide receivers. McLaurin had a $23.25 million average in his last deal, which now ranks 16th.

McLaurin said he can't speculate on how Wilson's deal affects his own situation, but said the top receivers are getting paid in today's NFL and he has demonstrated he is a No. 1 receiver.

Wilson will turn 25 next week. McLaurin, in contrast, will be 30 in September.

McLaurin is coming off his most productive season, after playing with th"

Five-star recruit Tyler Atkinson, ESPN's No. 1 outside linebacker in the 2026 class, announced his commitment to Texas during an appearance on the ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Tuesday, handing the Longhorns a coveted pledge over finalists Clemson, Georgia and Oregon .

Atkinson, who plays at Georgia's Grayson High School, is the No. 14 overall prospect in the 2026 ESPN 300 and one of the nation's most productive high school defenders. He follows No. 1 overall quarterback Dia Bell (No. 4 in the ESPN 300) and defensive end Richard Wesley (No. 11) as the third five-star recruit to join Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian's incoming recruiting class.

""What really told me to go to Texas was the coaches -- the relationship piece, the atmosphere,"" Atkinson told McAfee. ""I feel like I just encompass everything I want at Texas ... the way they have me playing is the best fit, and that's why I chose Texas.""

Long favored to land with the Bulldogs, Atkinson's Longhorns pledge marks Texas' latest recruiting victory over its newly minted SEC rivals, arriving just eight months after Sarkisian & Co. swooped in to beat Georgia to five-star in-state defensive tackle Justus Terry (No. 8 overall) in the 2025 class last December.

Atkinson, the No. 1 recruit in the state of Georgia in 2026, visited the Bulldogs more than a dozen times throughout his recruitment. ESPN sources continued to view Georgia as a front-runner in his process into mid-June before Texas pulled level in the race following Atkinson's official visit weekend June 20-22.

Sources close to the recruitment told ESPN that a tight battle between Texas and Georgia came down to the ""small details"" in recent days.

A three-year starter at Grayson High School in Loganville, Georgia, Atkinson has been credited with 483 tackles, 93 hurries and 31.5 sacks since his fresh"
Leicester appoint Cifuentes as new manager,Leicester have confirmed Marti Cifuentes as their new manager.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/13397131/marti-cifuentes-leicester-appoint-former-qpr-boss-as-their-new-manager-ahead-of-championship-season,Sky Sports,,Sports,"Leicester have confirmed Marti Cifuentes as their new manager.

Cifuentes replaces Ruud van Nistelrooy, who left the King Power Stadium after seven months in charge following the Foxes' relegation to the Championship.

Cifuentes has signed a two-year deal at the King Power Stadium, with the option of a further year.

The 43-year-old was at fellow second-tier club Queen's Park Rangers but at the end of June after being placed on gardening having held talks with West Bromwich Albion over their head coach vacancy. Cifutentes was not given the job, with Ryan Mason taking over instead.

Leicester have paid a £500,000 fee in compensation to QPR - with Cifuentes paying exactly half of that by foregoing some of the wages and the signing-on fee he is due from the Foxes. Effectively, Cifuentes is taking a pay cut to take charge at the Midlands club.

The Spanish head coach was happy to do so and offered that to his new employers - because he is excited by the project, albeit with finances very tight at Leicester, and with the prospect of a points deduction looming over the club for alleged PSR breaches.

Leicester are also likely to have to sell players before they can buy any new recruits this summer.

The new Foxes manager is in line take charge of the team for the behind-closed-doors friendly against Leicester's sister club, OH Leuven, on Saturday, before they head to Austria on Wednesday for a pre-season training camp.

Leicester's Championship season starts on August 10 with a home game against Sheffield Wednesday.

""She's the top dog,"" Scotney told Sky Sports. ""Amanda, what she's carried for women's boxing, it's obviously on her terms now who she fights whether she does or not. Of course that's a fight I'd love. She's a legend.

""To be among those names and build that legacy, those are people that you need.""

Serrano had moved up to 136lbs to fight Katie Taylor for the Irish star's undisputed super-lightweight championship. But the Puerto Rican is naturally smaller and holds the WBO and WBA belts at featherweight. If she is to fight on, she's likely to move back down.
